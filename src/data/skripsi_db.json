Carries is a disease of dental tissue, which occurs on the outer surface of teeth and spread to the inner part of teeth. This is caused by the interaction of many factors both inside and outside mouth. If carries is not taken care well, it can make the condition of teeth is getting worse and even sometimes the teeth must be pulled out so that teeth which have a function to chew food, to speak and to beautify the performance cannot work well. Health indicator in dental carries of temporary teeth (gigi susu) is def-t and the index of permanent teeth DMF-T. Problem : The prevalence of dental carries on students of state elementary school in Palembang in 2007 is unknown. Objective : Knowing the prevalence and the status of dental carries of the students of state elementary school in index def-t and DMF-T. Methods : This is a descriptive research in 268 state elementary school in Palembang with 132,267 students. The number of samples is 819 students which taken by purposive sample technique.This research was conducted in December 2007 at State elementary schools no.238, 144, 42, 117 in 4 sub districts. The analysis data of dental carries is measured by dividing the amount of dental carries with the number of samples. The analysis status of dental carries is scored by using the average of def-t and DMF-T on the students of those elementary schools in Palembang. The result of this research shows that the prevalence of dental carries on state elementary school is high , 92,4%. It means only 7,57% of them is free from carries. The index of carries in temporary teeth in average def-t on the students is high, 4,46 and the index of carries in permanent teeth in average def-t on the students is quite low, 1,51. However, the endurance of teeth is low, 0,01% based on the number F(filling).

    "abstract": "Permukaan gigi tiruan yang kasar yang menghadap pada mukosa mulut dapat menjadi tempat pertumbuhan Candida albicans. Hal ini dikarenakan pembersihan oleh saliva sulit dilakukan pada daerah tersebut, sehingga terjadi penumpukan plak. Plak merupakan media yang sangat baik untuk pertumbuhan Candida albicans dan memperbanyak diri melebihi normal. Candida albicans, yang merupakan flora normal di dalam rongga mulut, akan menyebabkan terjadinya keradangan pada mukosa bila jumlahnya melebihi normal. Salah satu cara pencegahan peningkatan jumlah Candida albicans adalah dengan cara merendam gigi tiruan dalam larutan pembersih gigi tiruan. Larutan pembersih gigi tiruan yang dapat digunakan antara lain rebusan lidah buaya merupakan sediaan yang dapat dibuat sendiri oleh masyarakat dan klorheksidin glukonat 0,2% yang banyak dijual di pasaran. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui perbandingan efektifitas rebusan lidah buaya dan klorheksidin glukonat terhadap jumlah Candida albicans pada lempeng akrilik sebagai larutan pembersih gigi tiruan. Penelitian ini dilakukan pada lempeng resin akrilik heat cured dengan tanpa pemolesan. Ukuran lempeng 10 x 10x2 mm.

    "abstract": "Karies gigi adalah suatu kerusakan progresif pada jaringan keras gigi seperti email, dentin, dan sementum yang disebabkan oleh aktivitas metabolisme dalam plak sehingga terjadi demineralisasi jaringan tersebut. Faktor terpenting etiologi karies adalah infeksi oleh mikroba flora mulut, gigi sebagai host, dan makanan, terutama yang mengandung karbohidrat. Tidak semua karbohidrat mempunyai derajat kariogenik yang sama. Dua karbohidrat yang sering digunakan pada industri makanan adalah sukrosa dan xylitol. Tujuan. Apakah ada perbedaan bermakna antara pengaruh sukrosa dan xylitol terhadap terjadinya karies gigi molar tikus putih. Metode. Jenis penelitian yang digunakan adalah eksperimen mumi. Sample penelitian dibagi menjadi 3 kelompok. Kelompok A diberi konsumsi makanan eksperimen sukrosa, kelompok B diberi konsumsi makanan eksperimen xylitol, dan kelompok C sebagai control diberi konsumsi makanan dasar. Data dianalisa dengan menggunakan uji Ttest. Hasil, kelompok tikus yang diberi sukrosa mengalami karies superfisialis sebanyak 32 gigi (26,67 %) dan karies media 88 gigi (73,33 %). Pada kelompok tikus yang diberi xylitol mengalami karies superfisialis 49 gigi (40,83 %) dan karies media 15 gigi (12,5 %). Kesimpulan. Terdapat perbedaan bermakna antara pengaruh makanan eksperimen sukrosa dan makanan eksperimen xylitol terhadap terjadinya karies pada tikus putih, dimana xylito\\ mempunyai efek lebih kecil dibanding sukrosa terhadap terjadinya karies gigi. \r\nKata Kunci: Sukrosa, Xylitol, Karies gigi",

    "abstract": "Gigi beijejal atau Crowding merupakan suatu istilah yang umum dalam bidang kedokteran gigi untuk menggambarkan satu atau beberapa gigi yang erupsi pada tempat yang tidak sebagaimana mestinya. Crowding yang tidak dirawat akan memacu terjadinya karies. Hal ini disebabkan karena posisi gigi yang tidak ideal sering membentuk celah atau tempat terselipnya sisa makanan sehingga menyulitkan dalam aksi pembersihan gigi. Seringkah bulu sikat tidak mampu mencapai beberapa bagian tertentu. Selain itu, kesalahan dalam hal menyikat gigi juga bisa mendukung terjadinya karies. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui berapa prevalensi karies pada gigi berjejal di lingkungan mahasiswa Program Studi Kedokteran Gigi Fakultas Kedokteran Universitas Sriwijaya. Metode penelitian yang digunakan adalah deskriptifcross sectional berupa sampling survey dan merupakan jenis penelitian non eksperimental. Hasil penelitian pada 58 orang sampel penelitian menunjukkan bahwa prevalensi karies pada gigi berjejal di lingkungan mahasiswa Program Studi Kedokteran Gigi Fakultas Kedokteran Universitas Sriwijaya adalah sebesar 67, 25 %. Dari hasil lembar kuisioner yang telah diisi oleh sampel penelitian menunjukkan bahwa 63, 79 % sampel mengalami kesulitan pada waktu menyikat gigi.

    "abstract": "Penyebab penyakit periodontal terutama adalah plak dan karang gigi. Plak gigi yang mengandung mikroflora patogenik merupakan salah satu fungsi utama terhadap terjadinya dan berkembangnya penyakit karies dan gingivitis. Penggunaan xylitol mampu mempercepat proses pembentukan kembali mineral gigi (mineralisasi) sehingga dapat membantu menurunkan pembentukan plak gigi. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui hubungan xylitol dengan penghambatan skor plak pada siswa SLTP. Jenis penelitian ini adalah survei dengan pendekatan cross-sectional. Sampel berjumlah 60 orang yang dibagi menjadi 2 kelompok, kelompok yang pertama siswa yang mengunyah xylitol dan kelompok lainnya non xylitol (kumur). Data yang diambil adalah penurunan skor plak dan skor plak tetap. Hasil penelitian ini adalah 90% responden xylitol yang mengalami penurunan skor plak dan 13,33% skor plak tetap. Dengan chi-square, koreksi yate 's dan significancy secara statistik (p<0.05) maka dapat disimpulkan terdapat hubungan antara xylitol dengan penghambatan skor plak. Perlu dilakukan penelitian lebih lanjut tentang hubunganxylitol dengan penghambatan skor plak dengan jumlah dan sampel yang lebih banyak serta waktu penelitian yang lebih lama. \r\nKata kunci: Plak, xylitol",

Researches about tooth cuka pempek\r\nand tooth erosion has once been commenced. Raharjo (1993) in his study revealed\r\nthat the addition ofbrown sugar, onion, and ebi (dried shrimps) in cuka pempek can\r\nincrease the amount of calcium, phosphale, andfluor. The increase of amount of\r\nphosphate and fluor is not followed by the decrease of tooth erosion because in\r\nreality the acidity of cuka pempek is the one playing the main role in the cause of\r\ntooth erosion. This research is aimed to know the influence of adding ebi in cuka\r\npempek in the tooth erosion. The method used in this research was laboratory\r\nexperiment using thirty maxillary canines which was randomly divided into three\r\ngroups. The first group was immersed in cuka pempek and synthetic saliva solution\r\n(pH ± 4.4), the second group was immersed in cuka pempek solution (pH ± 4.3), and\r\nthe third group was immersed in cuka pempek solution with ebi addition. The\r\nmeasurement of these three groups was done in 0 day, 1 day, 3 days, and 5 days\r\nusing Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS). The data acquired from the\r\nmeasurement was analyzed with one way anova and then continued with Post-Hoc\r\nBonferroni. Within the group of immersed tooth in cuka pempek solution with ebi\r\nadditioning it has been attained the result ofcalcium decrease of 139,287 ppm in 5\r\ndays immersion.

    "abstract": "Gingivitis merupakan inflamasi yang terjadi pada gingiva, bersifat reversibel yang terutama disebabkan karena akumulasi plak dalam jumlah besar di regio interdental yang terlindung. Inflamasi gingiva cenderung dimulai pada daerah papila interdental dan menyebar dari daerah ini ke sekitar servikal gigi. Secara klinis gingivitis dapat dikenali dari tanda-tanda inflamasi seperti kemerahan, pembengkakan, perdarahan, adanya cairan dan terdapat rasa sakit. Penyikatan gigi secara rutin sangat dibutuhkan untuk mencegah penimbunan plak dan mengurangi tingkat keparahan gingivitis. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menilai efektifitas metode menyikat gigi Modified Bass yang dapat mengurangi tingkat keparahan gingivitis dan menghilangkan plak dari dalam sulkus gingiva. Penelitian ini menggunakan uji klinik acak (randomized clinical trial). Populasi penelitian ini adalah pasien yang mengalami gingivitis yang berkunjung ke Poliklinik Gigi RS. AK. Gani. Dalam periode bulan Desember 2009- Januari 2010 didapat 120 subjek penelitian, yang secara acak dimasukkan ke dalam kelompok kontrol dan kelompok perlakuan. Dalam penelitian ini variabel bebas adalah metode menyikat gigi Modified Bass dan variabel tegantung adalah tingkat keparahan gingivitis. Dalam penelitian ini bahwa metode menyikat gigi Modified Bass lebih terbukti lebih efektif dibanding metode menyikat gigi lainnya dalam mengurangi tingkat keparahan gingivitis (p= 0,092 dan nilai a sebesar 0,05). Dilakukan analisis univariat dan bivariat serta Uji Independen Antara Dua Faktor menggunakan statistik uji Mest. Untuk meningkatkan validitas data tentang metode menyikat gigi dan menjamin kepatuhan subjek perlu dilakukan dengan metode kontrol tertentu, baik dengan pengamatan langsung, maupun dengan, misalnya, menelpon subjek pada menjelang waktu mereka biasa menyikat gigi. \r\nKata kunci: Gingivitis, metode menyikat gigi ModifiedBass, uji klinik acak.",

Hasil dari penelitian ini adalah pada kontrol negatif (aquades steril) mempunyai jumlah rerata koloni Candida albicans sebanyak 59,5; kontrol positif (NaOCl 2%) sebanyak 0; rebusan daun semanggi konsentrasi 20% sebanyak 7; rebusan daun semanggi 50% sebanyak 3,75 dan rebusan daun semanggi 80% sebanyak 0,25. Dari hasil penelitian maka dapat disimpulkan bahwa perendaman basis akrilik selama 30 menit dalam rebusan daun semanggi dengan konsentrasi 80% berpengaruh optimal dalam menghambat pertumbuhan Candida albicans pada basis akrilik gigi tiruan lepasan. Disarankan perlu penelitian lebih lanjut untuk mengetahui kadar zat-zat aktif lainnya pada daun semanggi yang berpengaruh dalam manghambat pertumbuhan koloni Candida albicans. \r\nKata kunci: Semanggi, Basis akrilik, Candida albicans.",

    "abstract": "One of the most widely used materials in prosthetic dentistry is acrylic resin. Excellent\r\nappearance, ease in processsing, and repairability, make acrylic resin as an excellent\r\ndenture base material. However, the primary problem is its poor strength characteristics,\r\nincluding low impact and flexural strength. Fracture strength of a denture base resin is of\r\ngreat concem, and many approaches have been used to strengthen acrylic resin dentures.\r\nStrengthening the acrylic resin prosthesis can be approached by modifying or reinforcing\r\nthe resin. Metallic mesh is a wire mesh that has traction, flexion, and press the large, this\r\nability to give strength to the metallic mesh to hold the object and puli while. The aim of\r\nthis study was to measure the transverse strength of a heat cured acrylic resin, after\r\nreinforcement with metallic mesh. The study carried out with two groups which\r\ncontained 10 specimens each. Group I consisted of 10 specimens with metallic mesh.\r\nSpecimens in group II (control group) consisted of 10 specimens without any\r\nreinforcement. The statistical analysis used is student t test after using goodness of fit\r\ntest. The result showed that transverse strengths of all test groups have any differences\r\nand there were statistically significant differences among group (a=0,01).

Karies gigi dapat dicegah dengan berbagai cara, salah satunya dengan menggunakan obat kumur antiseptik, misalnya Klorheksidin. Buah-buahan juga dapat dimanfaatkan untuk mencegah karies antara lain buah anggur yang dapat memproduksi kismis. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui perbedaan perbandingan kumur-kumur ekstrak kismis dengan klorheksidin terhadap jumlah koloni Streptococcus mutans pada saliva anak SD Baptis Palembang. Sampel diambil dari saliva anak SD Baptis Palembang sebanyak 50 anak yang terbagi dalam 5 kelompok perlakuan. Pasien diintruksikan kumur ekstrak kismis konsentrasi 20 %, 40 %, 80 %, klorheksidin serta aquades steril kemudian salivanya diinokulasikan pada media TSA dan diinkubasi selama 24 jam sebelum dilakukan uji jumlah koloni. Analisis dilakukan dengan uji ANOV A dengan menggunakan SPSS 16 for Windows. Hasil uji anova menunjukkan ada perbedaan yang bermakna jumlah koloni bakteri streptococcus mutans setelah kumur ekstrak kismis 20 %, 40 %, 80 %, klorheksidin 0, 12 % dan aquades steril (p<0,05 %). Pada uji LSD menunjukkan adanya perbedaan yang bermakna pada masing-masing kelompok perlakuan (p<0,05 %). Dapat disimpulkan kumur ekstrak kismis dapat mengurangi jumlah koloni bakteri streptococcus mu/ans.",

    "abstract": "Background : Radicular cysts are the most common cystic lesions affecting the jaws. They are most commonly found at the apices of teeth with necrotic pulps or defective root canal filling. It presupposes that physical, chemical or bacteria injury resulting in death of pulp followed by stimulation of epithelial cell rests of Malassez, which normally can be found in periodontal ligament. But it still unclear how are the epithelial cell rests stimulated to proliferate and how does the bone destruction occurs throughout cyst growth. Aims : The purpose of this study is to give a short overview of the molecular mechanisms of radicular cyst formation. Content : It was reported that the inflamed cells in periapical of necrotic teeth can induce the production of proinflamma tory cytokines and growth factors, which those factors mediate proliferation of epithelial cell rests. As the cysts develop, the surrounding bone will get resorbed, The expression of receptor activator NF?B-ligand (RANKL) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) were found in cyst cavity, which suggest the significance of these molecules in mediate bone resorption in inflammatory periapical lesions. Conclusion : Radicular cysts are most likely induced by the initiation of an inflammatory focus of necrotic teeth which trigger proliferation of epithelial and bone resorption.",

    "abstract": "Chitosan is a derivative of chitin which has potential for use in bone regeneration and has been reported can stimulate bone formation. Oxidative stress as one cause of bone damage, was found increased in osteoporosis, periodontitis and arthritis. One of the species oxygen reactive (ROS), hydrogen peroxide, has been reported can inhibit osteoblast pro-liferation. This study was aimed to investigate the effect of various chitosan concentrations on protein content in the culture medium of human osteoblast-like cell line, MG 63, which was exposed to hydrogen peroxide. MG 63 cells were exposed to various chitosan concentrations (% w/v) 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 1.6%. Culture cells without chitosan were used as a control. Cells were growth with \\ensuremathα-MEM medium (37?C, 5% CO2) until they became confluent, then they were exposed to hydrogen peroxide for 4 hours. The protein content in the culture medium was measured by using Bradford protein assay at 655 nm wavelength. The result showed that hydrogen peroxide decreased protein concentration in the medium culture compared with group without hydrogen peroxide. Treatment group with chitosan concentration 0.4% and 1.6% exhibited a significant increasing of protein concentration in osteoblast culture medium compared with control. In conclusion, in osteoblast culture medium chitosan can inhibit the decreasing of total protein concentration which was caused by oxidative stress",

    "abstract": "Resin komposit kini telah dikembangkan dengan cara diperkuat oleh fiber.\r\nRestorasi ini dikenal dengan istilah fiber-reinforced composite. Leno-weave fiber\r\nmerupakan salah satu contoh fiber yang memberikan penguatan terhadap restorasi\r\nfiber-reinforced composite. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui pengaruh\r\npenambahan leno-weave fiber pada resin komposit hibrida terhadap kekuatan tekan\r\nrestorasifiber-reinforced composite.\r\nSubyek penelitian adalah 30 sampel resin komposit hibrida yang dibagi ke\r\ndalam tiga kelompok. Kelompok pertama tanpa penambahan fiber, kelompok kedua\r\ndengan penambahan satu lembar fiber, dan kelompok ketiga dengan penambahan dua\r\nlembar fiber posisi saling silang berhimpit. Sampel berbentuk lempeng dengan\r\ndiameter 5 mm dan tebal 3 mm. Setiap sampel disinari selama 20 detik dan direndam\r\ndalam akuades selama 24 jam dalam suhu ruang, kemudian dilakukan uji kekuatan\r\ntekan dengan Hydraulic Universal Testing Material Tester. Data dianalisa dengan\r\nANOVA satu jalur dan dilanjutkan dengan uji Bonferonni.\r\nHasil penelitian menunjukkan kekuatan tekan pada resin komposit tanpa\r\npenambahan fiber sebesar 130,242±28,540 MPa, pada penambahan satu lembar fiber\r\n163,424±23,725 MPa dan dua lembar fiber 234,242±26,986 MPa.

    "abstract": "Children in mixed dentition period have a high risk of dental caries because they\r\noften eat carbohydrates, especially sucrose between meals. 5-10 minutes after\r\nconsuming sucrose, oral pH drops below 5 or 5.5. One of the preventive measures to\r\nprevent the decrease of salivary pH is chewing sugar-free gum as xylitol or sorbitol.\r\nThe content of xylitol and sorbitol in chewing gum has the effect to stimulating\r\nsalivary flow capacity, increased salivary secretion, and decreased colonization of\r\nStreptococcus mutans. This will lead to an increase in the buffer capacity of saliva\r\nthat can neutralize the pH drops due to carbohydrates glycolysis. The purpose of this\r\nsiudy was to compare salivary pil between chewing gum containing xylitol with\r\nsorbitol after consuming sucrose. This research is a quasi experimental. The sample\r\nsize is 30 samples that have met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The samples\r\nwere divided into 3 groups, a group that chewing gum containing xylitol} a group that\r\nchewing gum containing sorbitol and control group S..

Genetic variations of immune response from host may contribute to increased risks for dental caries. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, which are the most polymorphic genes in the genome, have important roles in the immune response to dental caries, since they can bind the peptide antigen from cariogenic bacteria. The purpose of this study is to give a short overview of the contribution of HLA polymorphism in the susceptibility to dental caries. It was reported that the genes within HLA complex were associated with altered enamel development and increased susceptibility to dental caries. Some variant of HLA class II molecules had been reported having correlation with lower IgA activity to cariogenic bacteria, and their frequency was increased in subject prone caries. Some specific HLA alleles also had been reported having significant association with high caries index. Thus, it can be concluded that polymorphism of HLA class II molecules may be influence individual susceptibility to dental caries. Key words : HLA polymorphism, dental caries, susceptibility",

    "abstract": "Chemotherapy in cancer patients can cause side effects in oral health. These side\r\neffects occur because chemotherapy agents not only destroy, suppress and prevent the\r\nspread of cancer cells but also affect normal cells. The cells that could be affected are\r\nsalivary gland cells. The chemotherapy agents will influence saliva secretion thus\r\ncause xerostomia. This study aimed to examine correlation between xerostomia and\r\nchemotherapy of cancer patients in RSUP Mohammad Hoesin Palembang. This case\r\ncontrol study was conducted in inpatient facility of RSUP Mohammad Hoesin\r\nPalembang from September 10^ to 17lh, 2012. The enrolled samples were divided\r\ninto two groups. The first group comprised 30 cancer patients who had at least 2\r\ncycles of chemotherapy and the second one comprised 30 patient Controls who didn’t\r\nget chemotherapy, didn’t suffer disease and didn’t take medications that can cause\r\nxerostomia. Patients were stated had xerostomia if wooden spatula adhered to buccal\r\nmucosa and salivary secretion was less than l,25ml for 5 minutes. At this study 80%\r\npatients who had chemotherapy have xerostomia with an odds ratio value is 26 (Cl\r\n95% = 6,532-103,498). This figure meant that 8 of 10 cancer patients have 26 greater\r\nrisk of suffering xerostomia.

    "abstract": "Zinc polycarboxylate is a luting cement used for permanent cementation of\r\nalloy restoration. One of disadvantages of this cement is its high solubility. Cement\r\ncan contact with various acid from food, beverage and also the acid produced by\r\nmicroorganism in oral cavily. It can ajfect the solubility of cement. One of acidic\r\nbeverages is fermented milk beverage. The aim of this study was to determine the\r\neffect o f fermented milk beverage on solubility of zinc polycarboxylate as luting\r\ncement. The samples used in this study were 32 cylindrical-shaped zinc\r\npolycabroxylate with 20 mm in diameter and J, 5 mm in height. The samples were\r\ndivided into four groups: zinc polycarboxylate immersed in distilled water (control),\r\nyoghurt, yakult, and kefir for 30,5 hours. Solubility was tested using a digital scale\r\nand the values were determined in %. The results showed that the highest\r\nsolubility was found in group immersed in kefir (3,805 ± 0,169%) while the lowest\r\nsolubility was found in group immersed in distilled water (0,896 ± 0,101%). The data\r\nwere analyzed by One Way ANOVA and continued by Post-Hoc LSD. The results of\r\nPost-Hoc LSD test showed that there were significant differences (p<0,05) in\r\nsolubility among groups, except between yoghurt and yakult group. It can be\r\nconcluded that the fermented milk beverage with various pH and lactic acid content\r\ncan increase the solubility of zinc polycarboxylate as luting cement.",

Sunflower seed oil contains linoleic acid and vitamin E which have roles in wound healing process, especially in inflammation phase. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the effects of sunflower seed oil on the healing of wounded rat labial mucosa. Method: twenty four male wistar rats with weigh 250-300 grams were divided into four groups. 2 mm deep incision was done on the lower labial mucosa of all rats. The wound of rats in group I, II, III were treated with sunflower seed oil topically 3, 2, and 1 time in 12 hours a day, respectively. Rats in group IV were treated with aquadest topically 3 times in 12 hours a day. Three rats of each group were sacrificed on the 1st day of the research, and the histological sections were made for reepithelialization observation. The rest rats were sacrificed on the 3rd day and the histological sections were made for collagen observation. Tissue continuity restoration was measured through reepithelialization rate and collagen pattern-orientation parameters. Data were analyzed by performing Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Mann-Whitney test. Result: all groups which received sunflower seed oil exhibited faster reepithelialization and denser collagen significantly than the control group.

    "abstract": "Resin komposit merupakan bahan restorasi yang banyak dipilih dokter gigi karena memiliki estetika serta sifat mekanis yang baik. Tetapi hal ini dapat dipengaruhi oleh paparan cairan dalam rongga mulut serta substansi kimia lainnya, salah satunya adalah obat kumur yang mengandung eugenol. Eugenol diketahui dapat menghambat reaksi polimerisasi serta mempengaruhi kekasaran permukaan resin komposit. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui pengaruh lama perendaman dalam obat kumur mengandung eugenol terhadap kekerasan permukaan resin komposit hibrida. Spesimen resin komposit hibrida (p60, 3M ESPE) dengan diameter 7 mm dan kedalaman 2 mm. Sampel dibagi menjadi empat kelompok (n=8) yaitu: kelompok Ai (3 jam perendaman), A2 (6 jam perendaman), A3 (9 jam perendaman), dan kelompok B (kontrol). Kekerasan permukaan sampel diuji menggunakan alat uji kekerasan Vickers Microhardness Tester. Analisi statistik menggunakan uji ANOVA satu arah dan uji Post Hoc LSD. Nilai hasil uji statistik ANOVA satu arah dan Post Hoc LSD menunjukkan perbedaan yang signifikan (p <0.005) pada nilai kekerasan permukaan resin komposit hibrida kelompok Ai, A2,dan A3.

Gigi tiruan penuh (GTP) adalah gigi tiruan paling efektif untuk mengatasi gangguan tersebut. Namun, seiring bertambahnya usia, terjadi penurunan fungsi yang diperburuk dengan adanya penyakit sistemik. Salah satunya adalah diabetes mellitus (DM). DM menimbulkan berbagai manifestasi oral yang dapat mengganggu kenyamanan pengguna GTP. Penelitian ini dilakukan untuk mengevaluasi kesehatan rongga mulut yang dihubungkan dengan kualitas hidup pada pasien pengguna GTP yang menderita DM di RSUP Dr. Moh. Hoesin Palembang pada periode Februari 2012 - September 2014. Penelitian ini merupakan suatu penelitian survei deskriptif dengan pendekatan cross sectional yang menggunakan teknik purposive sampling. Sampel dalam penelitian ini adalah 30 pasien pengguna GTP yang menderita DM dengan stabilitas dan retensi serta kebersihan GTP yang baik. Kesehatan rongga mulut yang dihubungkan dengan kualitas hidup diukur menggunakan kuisoner OHIP-14, dan keadaan rongga mulut dilihat melalui keadaan jaringan mukosa dan ketinggian serta bentuk linggir alveolar. Kesehatan rongga mulut yang dihubungkan dengan kualitas hidup dievaluasi. Dari hasil penelitian diketahui 93,33% subjek penelitian memiliki kualitas hidup yang baik, 70% subjek penelitian memiliki linggir berbentuk V atau tapering, 76,67% memiliki linggir alveolar dengan derajat resorpsi sedang dan 56,67% memiliki mukosa teriritasi. Subjek penelitian dengan kualitas hidup yang buruk memiliki linggir alveolar yang rendah dan datar serta mukosa yang patologis. Dari hasil penelitian, diketahui bahwa sebagian besar subjek penelitian memiliki tingkat kesehatan rongga mulut yang dihubungkan dengan kualitas hidup dengan kategori baik. Keadaan jaringan pendukung sangat mempengaruhi tingkat kesehatan rongga mulut yang dihubungkan dengan kualitas hidup tersebut.",

    "abstract": "Background: Remineralization is a process to replace mineral loss from dental hard tissue due to demineralization process. One of the remineralizing agent used frequently is CPP-ACP that can inhibit demineralization and enhance remineralization of tooth structure, beside CPP-ACP there is another agent that can enhance enamel remineralization which is theobromine. Theobromine is the principle xanthine species in cacao beans. Cacao can be developed as a remineralizing agent in cacao paste form. Objective:  The aim of this study was to determine the effect of CPP-ACP and cacao paste on hardness of enamel surface. Methods: 30 first and second maxillary and mandibular premolars were cut, only the crown was used in the experiment, then divided into five groups. After baseline hardness measurements with Vicker's Hardness Tester, the specimens were demineralized by phosphoric acid for 60 sec. After washing the specimens under distilled water, and then applied with CPP-ACP and cacao paste for 3 minutes. Then they were kept in artificial saliva solution for 24 hours, then after remineralization hardness of enamel surface was measured. Data were analyzed using paired t test, One Way ANOVA and Post Hoc LSD to determine the effect of CPP-ACP and cacao paste on hardness of the enamel surface. Results:  The results showed statistically significant differences between baseline and after remineralization. Cacao paste 7,5% had a significant difference in enhance enamel surface hardness compared with cacao paste 2,5% and 5%. but the means difference of those number was not significant when it was compared to CPP-ACP.. Conclusion: Cacao paste 7,5% had similar ability with CPP-ACP  to enhance hardness of the enamel surface.",

    "abstract": "Dental plaque contributes to the development of dental caries. Mouthwash can be used to reduce dental plaque. Chlorhexidine is a gold standard mouthwash, but with certain limitations. Cucumber juice is known to have antibacterial effect and to neutralize pH with minimal side effects. Hence, it is considered as an alternative mouthwash. This study aimed to compare plaque index and pH after rinsing with cucumber juice and 0,12% chlorhexidine. The experimental study which used pretest-posttest with control group design was conducted on 32 students of Al-Amalul Khair Boarding School aged 12-15 years, modification of Turesky-Gillmore-Glickmann from Quigley-Hein plaque index ≥1,5, and saliva pH ≥7.\r\nSubjects were randomized equally into two groups which were instructed to rinse with 10 ml of the assigned mouthwash. Before conducting the study, they were asked to refrain from oral hygiene procedures for 24 hours. Supragingival plaque index and pH were measured before\r\nand after rinsing. Plaque index was measured by using modification of Turesky-Gillmore- Glickmann from Quigley-Hein index, whereas plaque pH was measured by using digital pH meter. Paired and independent t test were used for statistical analysis. Results showed that\r\nplaque index decreased significantly after rinsing with cucumber juice or 0,12% chlorhexidine (p<0,05), but there was no significant difference between the groups (p>0,05).\r\nThere was no statistically significant increase in plaque pH in both group (p>0,05), but the difference between two groups was statistically significant (p<0,05). It can be concluded that cucumber juice can decrease plaque index, but it is not effective to increase plaque pH.",

    "abstract": "Background: Dental caries is still one of the general cronically problem for the children and adults, even this it mostly could be prevented. One of the factors that influence of dental caries is race. In particular race, those who have narrow jaw cause place to grow the teeth on the less jaw, so the teeth grows often irregularly. Irregularity of teeth will complicate the cleansing of the teeth and it will increase the percentage of caries.\r\nAims: The purpose of this study was to determine the comparison of caries severity in twelve-year-old children in Arab with Chinese ethnic (study cross sectional at SD Adabiyah and SD Xaverius 4 Palembang).\r\nMaterial and Method: This study was an observational analytic with a cross-sectional study design and using sampling methods were purposive sampling. This study consisted of 60 samples (30 Arabic ethnics at SD Adabiyah and 30 Chinese ethnics at SD Xaverius 4 Palembang), age in twelve-year-old. . Data were analyzed using chi-square test.\r\nResult: There were significantly different (p<0.05) caries severity in twelve-year-old children in Arab with Chinese ethnic at SD Adabiyah and SD Xaverius 4 Palembang. DMFT index in children of Arab ethnic was higher than Chinese ethnic which was 3,76 (moderate), DMFT index in the children of Chinese ethnic was 2,5 (low).\r\nConclusion: There were difference of caries severity in twelve-year-old children in Arab with Chinese ethnic (study cross sectional at SD Adabiyah and SD Xaverius 4 Palembang).",

Black tea was the most kind of drink that consumed and served in cold or hot conditions. The higher temperature water tends to increase corrosion rate. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of black tea drinks with temperature variation on the corrosion rate of orthodontic stainless steel wires. Thirtysix of cylindrical stainless steel wires were 0.016 inches in diameter and a length of 10 cm were divided into 6 groups, namely group A wires were immersed in tea at a temperature of 600C, B in tea at 250C, C in tea at 600C, D in aquadest at 600C, E in aquadest at 250C, and F in aquadest at 600C. Corrosion rate was observed by metal ions released after 8,5 hours of immersion. It was detected using Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP). Data were analyzed by ANOVA test and Post-Hoc LSD. The number of nickel ions released in tea was increased by increasing the temperature, while in aquadest the released of nickel ions were not detected. The highest number of chromium ions released after immersed in tea at group B and decreased significantly at group C, while in aquadest showed highest at group D and decreased significantly at group E.

If the information can be accessed by patient through seeing and listening, then there will be an increase in understanding and maintaining the information, so it gives positive effect on reducing patient anxiety. This study aims to determine the comparison of animation and non-animation presurgical video education effects toward anxiety level in odontectomy patients. This research is a quasy experiment. 32 odontectomy patients were divided into group A (animation pre surgical video education) and group B (non-animation presurgical video education). The samples filled out the Modification of IDAF-4C questionnaire to find out the initial anxiety, followed by watching the video, and refilling the questionnaire to find out the difference in anxiety levels. The result using dependent t-test showed that there were no significant differences (p>0.05) of odontectomy anxiety between before and after giving the video to both groups. Based on the percentage, it is known that there was an average decreased of 2.15% in group A and 4.80% in group B. Independent t- test showed that there were no significant difference between the two groups (p>0,05). The conclusion is there were no significant difference between animation and nonanimation presurgical video education effects toward anxiety level in odontectomy patients, but based on average score it is known that non-animation video can slightly reduce anxiety level of odontectomy patients compared to animation.",

    "abstract": "Composite resin is placed into the cavity with a depth of 2 mm using an incremental technique, and requires a relatively long time. Bulk fill composite resin is the development of coventional composite resin which can be placed into the cavity up to 4 mm depth in one stage. Addition of irradiation time can increase the degree of conversion, which will affect the mechanical properties. This study aims to determine the effect of irradiation time on surface hardness of bulk fill composite resin. Thirty samples were divided into 3 groups, with 3 irradiation times namely group A (20 seconds), B (30 seconds), and C (40 seconds). Each sample is cured using a light curing unit with an intensity of 1000-1200 Mw/cm2, then the surface hardness is measured using Vickers hardness. The mean of surface hardness of group A was 73.101 ± 6.94061, B 87,644 ± 4,33339, and C (111,827 ± 13,15363). The results of statistical test showed that there are significant differences in surface hardness among all groups. The conclusion of this study is that if the longer the irradiation time, the higher surface hardness.",

Most of the patients who visit dentists today have realized and want a more attractive and more aesthetic appearance of teeth when smiling. The aesthetic smile has a balance in the proportions of lips, teeth and gingiva. But sometimes the disharmony resulted in the appearance of a smile to be not ideal. Gummy smile is a condition characterized by excessive exposure of the maxillary gingiva when smiling. One of the periodontal surgical treatments that can be done to correct gummy smile is crown lengthening. Crown lengthening is a periodontal surgical procedure aimed at reducing the periodontal tissue to increase the length of the clinical crown. The crown lengthening procedure involves removing the gingival margins towards the apical tooth, thus increasing the length of the clinical crown. Crown lengthening surgical methods include gingivoplasty / gingivectomy procedures; apically positioned flap with or without ostectomy. This article aims to find indications, preoperative analyzes, and various methods in the surgical crown lengthening as one of the treatment options in the case of a gummy smile. Crown lengthening is one of the therapeutic options in a gummy smile. The selection of techniques is based on indications for each case to obtain optimal care outcomes.",

Data were analyzed using One Way ANOVA\r\nfollowed by Post-Hoc Bonferroni test. The result showed that the papaya leaf\r\ninfusion significantly inhibited the growth of C. albicans compared with negative\r\ncontrol with p=0,00 (p<0,05), but the efficacy was still less than positive control.\r\nInhibiton zone of papaya leaf infusion was started to form at concentration of\r\n20%. The higher concentration showed the higher mean inhibition zone. MIC and\r\nMBC value of papaya leaf infusion was 10%. It can be concluded that papaya leaf\r\ninfusion can be used as an alternative of antifungal agent.",

Smear layer consist of organic, inorganic and microorganism from infected pulp. Smear layer could cause root canal treatment failure especially on the apical third region of root canal which is the main focus of root canal preparation. There is no single irrigant which qualify as an ideal irrigant. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 25% extract of white turmeric (Curcuma zedoaria) as an irrigation solution on apical third  region of root canal cleanliness. Eighteen root samples from mandibular premolars used in this study were placed in wax block. Three groups of root samples were instrumented with protaper for hand use and irrigated as follow: group 1 with 25% extract of white turmeric, group 2 (positive control) with NaOCl 2,5% and followed by final irrigant with EDTA 17%, and group 3 (negative control) with aquadest. Each sample  was cutted  longitudinally and placed back in wax block, then observed by two raters using measuring microstructure microscope at 50x magnification. Measuring level of cleanliness of root canal were analyze with Kappa test, followed by Kruskal-wallis, and Mann-whitney. The results showed that there were no significant difference of cleanliness of root canal cleanliness (p>0,05) between group 1 and group 2, so it can be concluded that 25% ethanol extract of white turmeric is effective to clean the apical third region of root canal.",

Various drugs in various forms are used to accelerate the\r\nhealing process, but mostly they have side effects. Therefore, traditional medicine, such as betel quid consisted of betel leaf,\r\nareca nut, gambier, and calcium hydroxide, is developed. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of wound healing\r\nprocess in male Wistar rats. A total of 30 male Wistar rats were taken and divided into 5 groups: Group 1, 2, and 3 (K1,K2,\r\nK3) were given 5%, 10% and 15% concentrations of betel quid extract oinments; Group 4 (K4) was positive control\r\n(hyaluronic acid 0.2% oinment); Group 5 (K5) was negative control (placebo oinment). One mm- diameter of lower lip\r\nmucosal wounds on rats were created by using cylinder diamond bur. The oinments were applied twice daily for 10 days.\r\nThe number of netrophils on first and third day were measured and the thickness of ephitelium on 10 days were determined.\r\nAll groups of betel quid extracts exhibited the reduction of the number of neutrophils on inflammatory phase. Group 3\r\nshown as the highest effect and had no significant different with positive control. Betel quid extracts in all groups also\r\nimproved epithelial thickness on proliferative phase, in which group II and group III had no significant different with\r\npositive control. Betel quid extract had effect on wound healing process in male Wistar rats due to its ability in supressing\r\ninflamation and in increasing reepithelization.",

    "abstract": "Background: Teeth can be at risk of damage such as dental erosion. Factors that lead to dental erosion can be divided into two factors, namely internal factors and external factors. External factors, for example, include exposure of acidic water which results in tooth demineralization. Peat water is acidic water with such a low pH that is expected to cause dental erosion. \r\nObjective: The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the use of peat water and the risk of dental erosion among the people of Dusun 3 KTM Sungai Rambutan Ogan Ilir. \r\nMethods: The sample of this study involved all residents of Dusun 3 Sungai Rambutan KTM who did not have GERD. The incidence of dental erosion was measured through the Eccless and Jenskins index. To measure pH of the water the water sample was brought to the laboratory and subsequently measured using a pH meter. Data from the observation were analyzed using the Spearman test. \r\nResults: The results of the test indicated a significant relationship, p = 0.001 (p <0.05). \r\nConclusion: From this result, it can be concluded that there is a significant relationship between the use of peat water and the risk of dental erosion among the people of 3 KTM Rambutan Ogan Ilir.",

    "abstract": "Background: Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is a common irrigant used for root canal treatment irrigation. Sodium hypochlorite has antibacterial properties but the higher the concentration used, the more toxic it is. HOCl- which is found in sodium hypochlorite works as an antibacterial by damaging cell membranes from bacteria which causes bacterial lysis. Cetrimide is a surfactant that has antibacterial properties and can be combined with sodium hypochlorite. Cetrimide has a antibacterial mechanism similar to sodium hypochlorite in inhibiting bacteria which is damaging bacterial cell membranes. Objective: To determine the effectiveness of antibacterial sodium hypochlorite 2.5% against Enterococcus faecalis compared with combination of sodium hypochlorite 2.5%  with cetrimide 0.25%. Methods: This study used a quasi experimental method, consisting of 4 groups (sodium hypochlorite 2.5%, combination of  sodium hypochlorite 2.5% with cetrimide 0.25%, cetrimide 0.25% and cetrimide 0.015%). The inhibitory test is carried out by measuring the diameter of the inhibition zone around the well. Data were analyzed by One Way ANOVA test and continued with Post Hoc test. Results: The average inhibitory zone was formed in all groups. Based on the category, the combination of sodium hypochlorite 2.5% with cetrimide 0.25% and sodium hypochlorite 2.5% had very strong antibacterial properties, cetrimide 0.25% and cetrimide 0.015% had strong antibacterial properties. All groups had significant differences except the combination of sodium hypochlorite 2.5% with cetrimide 0.25% which had a inhibition zone of 23.675 mm and sodium hypochlorite 2.5% had 22 mm. Conclusion: The combination of  sodium hypochlorite 2.5% with cetrimide 0.25% was more effective than sodium hypochlorite 2.5% as an antibacterial against Enterococcus faecalis.",

Modification of composite resin produces a new type of composite resin that could be filled with a depth of 4 mm known as bulk-fill composite resin. The hardness of composite resin influenced by the exposure time and light intensity of the light curing unit. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the exposure time of light emitting diode on under-surface hardness of resin composite bulk-fill. This experimental laboratory used post test only design where 30 bulk-fill composite resin samples (Bulk Fill Posterior: 3M ESPE) were divided into three groups (5 seconds, 10 seconds and 20 seconds exposure time). The three groups were polymerized on the top surface using light emitting diode (Elipar ™ Deep Cure LED Curing Light). The samples were  immersed in a petri dish containing distilled water for 24 hours at 37 ̊C. Under-surface hardness of bulk-fill composite resin measured by the Vicker's Hardness Tester which is set at 500g in 10 seconds. Data were analyzed by Kruskal Wallis and post hoc Dunn-Bonferroni. The results of the Kruskal Wallis test showed that there was an effect of the difference in light emitting diode exposure time against the under-surface hardness of bulk-fill resin composite. The results of the post hoc Dunn-bonferroni test showed that there were significant differences (p <0.05) between groups with a 5 second exposure time (84.53 ± 8.75) with 10 seconds (119.637 ± 13.97) and 5 seconds with 20 seconds (143.182 ± 20.66), but there was no significant difference in the group with exposure time of 10 seconds with 20 seconds.

Some studies showed that patients with beta-thalassemia have low salivary flow rate and acidic saliva. A reduction in salivary flow rate and pH would increase caries susceptibility. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between salivary flow rate and pH with DMFT index in patients with beta-thalassemia major. This study was a cross-sectional design. A total of 38 patients with beta-thalassemia major aged more than 12 years old at Dr. Mohammad Hoesin Palembang Hospital were included in this study. Their unstimulated saliva was collected by spitting methods, and the teeth were examined with DMFT Index. The salivary flow rate was expressed as ml/min and the pH was measured using a saliva pH indicator paper. Data were analyzed using Pearson correlation test to determine the correlation between variables. The result showed that the mean age of the patients in this study was 16.6 years old, with a higher number of female patients than males. Patients with beta-thalassemia major had low salivary flow rate (0.72 ml/5 min), acidic saliva (6.34), and high DMFT index (8.34). This correlation was statistically significant (p<0.01). It can be concluded that there is a strong negative relation between DMFT index with salivary flow rate and salivary pH in patients with beta-thalassemia major.",

This study aim was to find out the level of public knowledge of illegal dental practices in the Tanjung Lago community, South  Sumatera.  One  hundred  people  in  Tanjung  Lago,  South  Sumatra  were  asked  to  fill  in  the questionnaire. The survey showed that the majority of the people of Tanjung Lago had visited illegal dental practices and they know that those who perform these dental treatments were not dentists. The most common type of treatment was removable prosthodotic. The main reason they come to these illegal practitioners was due to the easy acces. Illegal dental practice is still widely visited by the community in performing dental care. This requires regular counseling efforts to increase public knowledge about the risks of going to illegal dental practices.",

    "abstract": "Elastik ortodonti merupakan komponen aktif pada perawatan ortodonti. Elastik ortodonti yang berada dalam rongga mulut berisiko terpapar saliva atau makanan dan minuman yang dapat mempengaruhi kekuatan tarik elastik ortodonti. Kopi merupakan minuman bersifat asam yang biasa dikonsumsi sehari-hari. Jenis kopi yang banyak dibudidayakan di Indonesia adalah kopi robusta dan kopi arabika. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui pengaruh minuman kopi robusta dan kopi arabika dan lama peregangan terhadap kekuatan tarik elastik ortodonti. Tiga puluh elastik ortodonti direndam dalam 3 larutan berbeda: (A) saliva buatan, (B) minuman kopi robusta, dan (C) minuman kopi arabika. Kekuatan tarik diukur menggunakan force gauge sebelum dan sesudah 24 jam dan  48 jam peregangan. Data dianalisis menggunakan uji One Way ANOVA dan uji Post-Hoc LSD, dilanjutkan dengan uji Repeated ANOVA serta Pairwise Comparison LSD. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan terdapat perbedaan kekuatan tarik elastik ortodonti yang signifikan antar ketiga kelompok. Elastik ortodonti yang direndam dalam minuman kopi arabika memiliki kekuatan tarik yang lebih rendah dibandingkan dengan minuman kopi robusta setelah 24 jam dan 48 jam peregangan. Kekuatan tarik elastik ortodonti setelah 48 jam peregangan lebih rendah daripada setelah 24 jam peregangan pada setiap kelompok. Kesimpulan dari penelitian ini adalah minuman kopi robusta, kopi arabika dapat menurunkan kekuatan tarik elastik ortodonti. Penurunan kekuatan tarik paling tinggi terjadi setelah 48 jam peregangan, namun kekuatan tersebut masih efektif untuk pergerakan gigi.\r\nKata kunci: elastik ortodonti, kekuatan tarik, kopi",

    "abstract": "Latar belakang : Penggunaan radiografi konvensional sering digunakan dalam pengukuran panjang kerja tetapi masih terdapat kekurangan dalam teknik tersebut. Electronic apex locator merupakan salah satu teknik pengukuran panjang kerja alternatif dan jauh lebih baik pada perawatan endodontik. Tujuan penelitian : Membandingkan hasil pengukuran panjang kerja antara radiografi konvensional periapikal dan Electronic Apex Locator serta untuk mengetahui kesesuaian (konsistensi) antara kedua alat ukur panjang kerja terhadap perawatan endodontik. Metode penelitian : Penelitian ini dilakukan dengan metode analitik observasional metode cross sectional. Terdapat 30 subjek gigi anterior maksila yang memiliki indikasi perawatan endodontik. Pengukuran panjang kerja menggunakan teknik radiografi periapikal teknik biseksi dengan metode Grossman dan electronic apex locator. Uji yang digunakan pada penelitian ini menggunakan uji inter-rater reliability (Cappa Kohen) dengan nilai signifikansi kurang dari 5% (p<0,05). Hasil Penelitian : Pengukuran panjang kerja antara radiografi konvensional teknik biseksi dengan electronic apex locator menunjukkan tingkat kesesuaian (konsistensi) dengan kategori sedang (fair). Sebanyak 30 subjek yang diteliti, terdapat 18 subjek (60%) memiliki hasil yang sama pada penggunaan kedua teknik pengukuran panjang kerja, sedangkan sebanyak 12 subjek (40%) memiliki hasil berbeda. Kesimpulan : Radiografi periapikal teknik biseksi dengan electronic apex locator tidak memenuhi syarat yang reliabel untuk pengukuran panjang kerja pada perawatan endodontik. Pengukuran panjang kerja antara radiografi konvensional dan electronic apex locator jika dikombinasikan akan menghasilkan suatu pengukuran panjang kerja yang lebih akurat sehingga perawatan endodontik akan sukses dan tepat.\r\n\r\nKata Kunci : apex locator, panjang kerja, perawatan endodontik, radiografi konvensional",

This research was aimed to determine the management of cases of acute pseudomembranous\r\ncandidiasis in hypertensive patients.\r\nCase presentation. A woman 16 years old came to the Mohammad Hoesin Hospital in Palembang with a\r\ncomplaint of a yellowish white spot on the upper surface of her tongue which she noticed since 2 weeks ago. The\r\nyellowish white patches feel sore when the patient brushes her tongue with a toothbrush. The patient was\r\nuncomfortable with the state of her tongue so she wants her tongue to be treated. The patient had a history of\r\nhypertension since 1 year ago. The patient was given the drug nystatin drop. In the first control, 1 week after\r\nadministration of the drug, white lesions on the tongue began to decrease and appear thinner compared to the\r\nprevious visit. In the next control, the patient's tongue was clean so that the use of nystatin was stopped.

    "abstract": "Background: The main goal of endodontic treatment is to remove vital tissue, necrotic tissue, microorganisms, and microorganism products from the root canal system. Irrigation solutions such as NaOCl and CHX are needed to achieve these goals, unfortunately, both solutions have unwanted side effects, therefore alternative solutions are required that can come from plant extracts because they have antibacterial properties, low cytotoxic effects, and easy to obtain. One of the plant extracts that can use as an alternative irrigation solution is 20% turmeric (Curcuma longa) rhizome extract because it has antibacterial properties and can dissolve the smear layer. However, C. longa contains a colorant called curcumin, which can cause discoloration on the root canal dentin. Aims: To determine the influence of 20% turmeric (Curcuma longa) rhizome extract on the root canal dentin discoloration. Material and Methods: This study was an in vitro experimental study. The treatment group used 20% C. longa rhizome extract, while the positive control group used 5.25% NaOCl and 2% CHX, and the negative control group used distilled water. The root canal dentin discoloration was measured based on the dE*ab value. Measurements were using a UV Vis 2401 PC spectrophotometer. The data obtained were analyzed using the One Way ANOVA test and Post Hoc Games Howell test. Results: 20% C. longa rhizome extract had a higher mean dE*ab value than the 5.25% NaOCl and 2% CHX group, and there was no significant difference between them. Distilled water had the smallest dE*ab value and didn’t cause discoloration on the root canal dentin. Conclusion: There is an influence of 20% turmeric (Curcuma longa) rhizome extract on the root canal dentin discoloration.",

    "abstract": "Background: Antibacterial effectiveness is the level of antibacterial agent’s ability in controlling bacteria through growth-inhibiting or killing activities. Antibacterial agents in dentistry can be synthetic or natural based on their sources. Natural source that has potency to be used as alternative is beetroot (Beta vulgaris L.) because it contains phenolic compounds, flavonoids, saponins, tannins, and betalains. Antibacterial agents have been widely used as preventive for dental caries in children with the main causative bacteria is Streptococcus mutans. Objective: To evaluate the antibacterial effectiveness of beetroot extract against Streptococcus mutans. Methods: This study was in vitro experimental laboratory study with post-test-only control group design. The maceration method’s used to obtain beetroot extract which will diluted into various concentrations, 12,500 µg/ml, 25,000 µg/ml, 50,000 µg/ml, and 100,000 µg/ml. Antibacterial effectiveness was tested by measuring the inhibition zone using disc diffusion, determining the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration  (MIC) using broth dilution, and the Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) using agar dilution with 0,2% chlorhexidine gluconate as positive control. Analysis of inhibition zone data was performed statistically using one-way ANOVA and Tukey Post Hoc. MIC and MBC tests were analyzed descriptively. Results: All concentrations of beetroot extract were able to form inhibition zone with the largest mean was 0.40 ± 0.05 mm, but still lower than positive control. MIC and MBC of beetroot extract were 25,000 µg/ml and 50,000 µg/ml respectively. Conclusion: Beetroot extract has antibacterial effectiveness against Streptococcus mutans, therefore it can be used as a natural alternative for dental caries prevention.",

The most commonly used of the maxillary incisor vertical angulation are +40 degrees for the North American population, +40 degrees for India population, and +45 to +55 degrees for Brazil population. The vertical angulation of bisecting technique may need to adjust to the proclination of the teeth which could be affected by races such as Indonesia which belong to the Mongoloid race. The present study aimed to determine an overview of vertical angulation of bisecting periapikal radiograph technique based on maxillary incisor inclination incisors of dentistry student Sriwijaya University. Method: This observational descriptive study was done with a cross sectional design using 67 dental casts from class of 2016-2017 student. The inclusion criterias of dental cast were in good condition of central incisor, class I malocclusion and normal overjet (2-4 mm). The dummy film was placed and fixed as close to the palate as possible. The angle formed between the long axis of the tooth and the occlusal line (BAO) and the angle formed between the axis of the film and the occlusal line (DAO) was measured using a protractor. The vertical angulation was calculated using the principle of geometry which then was processed descriptively. Result: The range of vertical angulations of the bisecting angle technique obtained was +37.50 to +61.50 degrees with a median value of +46.50 degrees and an average value of +47.57 degrees. Conclusion: The average value of vertical angulation in this study was still within the range of vertical angulation used in the Brazilian population.\r\nKeywords: bisecting technique, periapical radiograph, vertical angulation",

    "abstract": "Background: Tooth extraction is the process of removing a tooth from the alveolar bone. Parts that are missing teeth will cause socket wounds. Socket wounds can undergo physiological healing, which is characterized by four phases of healing, namely hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and maturation. The reepithelialization process is thought to be accelerated by using herbal ingredients, namely plantain sap (Musa paradisiaca Var. Raja) which contains tannins, flavonoids and saponins. Objective: To determine the effective concentration in the application of plantain (Musa paradisiaca Var. Raja) sap gel against reepithelialization of socket wounds after tooth extraction of wistar rats.Materials and Methods: This study is an in vivo experimental study. A total of 28 white rats R.norvegicus wistar strain were divided into 4 treatment groups. The positive control group used chlorhexidine, while the treatment group was given 20%, 40% and 70% banana sap gel, the mice were adapted for 3 days. On the 4th day, 0.2 ml ketamine was administered intramuscularly, followed by extraction of the rat's teeth using an excavator and needle holder. Each treatment group and positive control were applied once a day for 14 days which would be euthanized on the 18th day. Socket tissue was taken and histological preparations were made, epithelial thickness was measured using a microscope and measured in m with three 400x magnification fields. Data were analyzed using Kruskal Wallis and Pairwise Comparison tests. Results: The results showed that 20% banana latex gel was the most effective in the re-epithelialization process compared to other treatment groups. Conclusion: The latex gel of plantain raja (Musa paradisiaca Var. Raja) can accelerate the process of re-epithelialization of socket wounds after tooth extraction.",

    "abstract": "Background: Discolored teeth can be treated through bleaching that is aimed at restoring the white color of the teeth. Previous studies showed that teeth whitening from hydrogen peroxide application can be improved by repeated its applications, however the use of this material still causes tooth surface roughness. 2.5% tangerine peel extract reported to have the potential to be an alternative bleaching material, therefore the teeth whitening degree from its repeated application needs to be evaluated further. Objective: Determine the effect of repeated application of 2.5% tangerine peel extract gel on the degree of teeth whitening. Material and Methods: Experimental research was conducted on 24 premolar teeth with C4 shade which color values (L*, a*, and b*) have been recorded using Colorimeter. 2,5% tangerine peel extract gel was applied to groups A and B. Positive control groups C and D were applied 40% hydrogen peroxide used as a comparison. In Groups B and D, the application was repeated twice. Tooth color after bleaching material application was measured and processed to obtain ∆L*, ∆a*, ∆b*, and ∆Eab*  values that will be subjected to One Way Anova and Post Hoc LSD statistical tests. Results: No significant difference was found in ∆a* and ∆b* values between all groups. Repeated bleaching application group produced significantly higher brightness (∆L*) and total color change values (∆Eab*) than others group. Conclusion: Repeated 2.5% tangerine peel extract gel application can increase teeth whitening degree, but it hasn’t been able to match tooth whitening degree from 40% hydrogen peroxide application.\r\n\t\r\nKeywords: Colorimeter, repeated application, tangerine peel extract, teeth whitening degree, tooth bleaching.",

The TMJ is a complex joint consisting of the glenoid fossa, mandibular condyle and disc articular. No previous studies have examined the correlation between free end edentulous and morphological variations in the mandibular condyles. Objective: to determine the correlation between unilateral free end edentulous and morphological variations of condyle using panoramic radiographs at South Sumatera RSKGM. Materials and Methods: This research is analytic observational using 68 samples of panoramic radiographs at RSKGM South Sumatra in September 2019 - March 2020. The sample was divided into 34 unilateral free end edentulous samples and 34 complete toothed samples. After that, the condyle morphology of each sample was traced and analyzed using the chi-square method in the SPSS application. Result: Morphological abnormalities of the condyles were more frequently seen in patients with unilateral free end edentulous conditions, that is 41.18%. While in patients with complete teeth, the visible abnormalities of the condyles was only 5.88%. Obtained a p-value of 0.002 or p <0.005 which statistically means that there is a significant correlation between unilateral free end edentulous and morphological variations of mandibular condyles. Conclusion: There is a correlation between unilateral free end edentulous and morphological variations of condyle using panoramic radiographs at South Sumatera RSKGM.",

A particular craniofacial cephalometric picture is found in the form of mild skeletal class II clinical manifestations. The anterior cranial base becomes a benchmark or reference sector in the measurement of dentofacial structures on cephalometric radiographs because it is considered relatively stable throughout craniofacial growth. Objective: The purpose of this systematic literature review was to determine the effect of beta thalassemia major on the length of the anterior cranial base observed through cephalometric analysis. Methods: References were selected using the PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases published from January 2007 to December 2021. The complete articles that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were then assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program bias assessment and summarized to obtain demographic data and length of the patient's anterior cranial base in the journal. Results: This systematic literature review succeeded in synthesizing 6 journals consisting of case-control studies with low bias assessment results in 4 journals and moderate bias assessment in 2 journals. All journals in this systematic literature review stated that the length of the anterior cranial base in patients with beta thalassemia major was not much different from the control group seen in cephalometric analysis.

    "abstract": "Background: Dental age is the age of the teeth which is determined based on the stage of tooth eruption and tooth formation or tooth maturation. Dental age is a good indicator for evaluating the biological age of a growing child because it is less affected by variations in nutritional and endocrine status than other biological age methods, and experiences less variation in relation to chronological age. Several methods can be used to estimate dental age using panoramic radiographs, one of which is the Demirjian and Nolla methods. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there was a difference in dental age using the Demirjian and Nolla method on panoramic radiographs at the Special Dental and Oral Hospital, South Sumatra Province. Method: This study was an analytic observational with a cross-sectional design using 380 panoramic radiographs of children aged 6-15 years for the period 2019-2021 at the at the Special Dental and Oral Hospital radiology installation. Dental age on panoramic radiographs was observed and analyzed by looking at the growth and development of teeth using the Demirjian and Nolla method, while chronological age was obtained by subtracting the date of radiograph taken with the patient's date of birth. Data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon test. Result: The Wilcoxon test showed no significant difference between chronological age and dental age using the Demirjian method (p-value > 0.05), while the significant difference between dental age using the Nolla method and chronological age (p-value <0.05). Conclusion: There are differences in the value of dental age using the Demirjian and Nolla method in estimating the age of children 6-15 years.",

    "abstract": "Background: Periodontal disease is the second most frequent dental and oral health problem In Indonesia. Porphyromonas gingivalis, prevalent in subgingival plaques, is the primary bacteria that cause periodontal disease. Periodontal disease can be prevented mechanically, chemically, or spontaneously by inhibiting plaque growth. Natural ingredients such as corn hair, which include antibacterial properties such as alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, and tannins, can be utilized as a chemical preventive alternative. Purpose: This study aimed to find out the antibacterial potency of corn hair extract (Zea mays saccharata Sturt) on the growth of Porphyromonas gingivalis. Materials and methods: The material used in this study was corn hair. This study was an experimental laboratory study in vitro. The treatment group used corn hair extract with concentrations of 25%, 50%, and 75% obtained through maceration methods. The positive control used 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate, and the negative control was used aquades. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration(MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) test were conducted using dilution methods and inhibition test using disc diffusion methods. Results: The results of the MIC test in this study could not be determined because the dark color of the extract blocked it, and the results of the MBC test were set at a concentration of 50%. The results of the inhibition zone test showed corn hair extract concentration of 75% had the largest inhibition zone diameter than other concentrations, which was 24 mm but still lower compared to 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate. Conclusion: Corn hair extract (Zea mays saccharata Sturt) has antibacterial potency against the growth of Porphyromonas gingivalis.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Enamel is the hardest substance in the human body and serves as the wearresistant outer layer of the dental crown. Demineralization releases mineral ions which \r\ncauses a decrease in the enamel surface hardness. Demineralization can be neutralized to recover minerals, and this process is called remineralization. Almond milk is an alternative to cow’s milk, supporting tooth enamel surface remineralization. Objective: To determine the effect of almond milk on enamel hardness. Methods: Twenty maxillary \r\npremolars were divided into group A (control) and group B (almond milk). Before treatment, samples were soaked in 1% citric acid. Enamel hardness was tested with Vickers Hardness Tester. The statistical tests used in this study were Paired t-test and Independent Sample t-Test. Results: The results of the paired sample test got significant \r\nresults in groups A and B in the comparison of pretest - 1% citric acid and 1% citric acid - posttest, which means that there is a significant difference in enamel hardness values. \r\nHowever, the results obtained were not substantial in groups A and B in the posttest�pretest comparison. There was no significant difference between Group A and Group B in \r\nthe independent sample test results. There was an increase before and after, but it was not much different when compared to the control. Conclusion: Almond milk can increase enamel surface hardness but cannot reverse the initial enamel surface hardness value.",

    "abstract": "Background: Saliva is a complex body fluid that provides a general protective function for the hard tissues of the mouth. The salivary function will run optimally if the salivary flow rate increases. Increased salivary flow rate has an effect on increasing salivary pH, due to an increase in the buffering capacity of saliva. Yogurt has high nutrition and can be considered as a way to prevent caries because yogurt contains probiotics and the acidic nature that can stimulate salivary flow chemically. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of consuming yogurt on increasing pH and salivary flow rate. Methods: This study used quasi experimental study using a pretest-posttest with control group design involved 40 subjects who were divided into 2 groups which are the group who consumed yogurt and the control group who gargled aqua distillate. Saliva was collected by spitting method before treatment and at the 5th, 10th, and 15th minutes after treatment. The collected saliva was noted as the average salivary flow rate in mL/min. Salivary pH was measured using a pH indicator. Data were analyzed using Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney U tests. Results: The results showed that after consuming yogurt, there was a significant increase in salivary pH and flow rate (p<0.05), except for the average pH value at the 5th minute. There was a significant difference in pH and salivary flow rate between treatment group and control group (p<0.05), except for the pH value at the 5th minute. Conclusion: Yogurt has an effect in increasing the pH and salivary flow rate.",

    "abstract": "Background: Extraction is a minor oral surgical procedure performed to remove a tooth \r\nor tooth root from its socket on the alveolar bone in the oral cavity. The process of tooth \r\nextraction causes hard and soft tissue damage. Currently, many studies use bio-based \r\nmaterials, for example those from plants. One type of plant that contains bioactive \r\ncompounds that can be developed is duku seeds. Based on phytochemical tests, duku \r\nseeds contain compounds that can accelerate the inflammatory phase of the wound \r\nhealing process, namely; flavonoids, triterpenoids, and saponins. Objective: To determine \r\nthe effect of administration of duku seed extract (Lansium domesticum corr) on the \r\nnumber of neutrophils after tooth extraction of Wistar rats. Methods: The type of research \r\nused is a true experimental laboratory with a post test only control group design research \r\ndesign as many as 48 wistar rats divided into 12 groups, namely 3 control groups \r\n(placebo gel) and 9 treatment groups (50% duku seed extract gel, 60% and 75% for 3 \r\ndays). The left maxillary incisor of the rat was anesthetized and then extracted using a \r\nneedle holder. After extraction, apply duku seed extract on the tooth sockets of the rat\r\naccording to the treatment group 2 times a day. Groups 1, 2, 3 and 10 were euthanized on \r\nday 1, groups 4, 5, 6 and 11 were euthanized on day 2, and groups 7, 8, 9 and 12 were \r\neuthanized on day 3, then tissues were taken and histological preparations were made. \r\nThe number of neutrophils was calculated using Olympus software and analyzed \r\nstatistically. Results: The average number of neutrophils in the treatment group was less \r\nthan the control group (both after treatment for 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days), there was a \r\nstatistically significant difference, especially in the 75% group. However, in the 50% and \r\n60% treatment groups there was an average difference that was not statistically \r\nsignificant. The average number of neutrophils (PMN) in the treatment group that was \r\ngiven 75% duku seed extract compared to placebo gel showed the largest average \r\ndifference. Conclusion: There was an effect of giving duku seed extract with \r\nconcentrations of 50%, 60% and 75% in reducing the number of neutrophils compared to \r\nthe control group (both after treatment for 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days). However, it was not \r\nstatistically significant in the 50% and 60% groups. Duku seed extract gel with a \r\nconcentration of 75% is the most effective concentration of duku seed extract in reducing \r\nthe number of neutrophils.",

Demineralization can be done by restoring mineral components through remineralization, one of the remineralizing materials is hydroxyapatite. Hydroxyapatite can be synthesized from natural materials such as fish bones. Objective: to determine the effect of catfish bone hydroxyapatite on the hardness of primary tooth enamel. Methods: Twenty-eight incisors were implanted in resin and divided into 2 groups. The tooth enamel hardness was measured (pretest) using a Microvicker's Hardness Tester and then continued with the remineralization process using hydroxyapatite paste synthesized from catfish bones using the precipitation method. The paste was applied to group A (15% HA paste) then soaked in artificial saliva and group B (control) was only soaked in artificial saliva. The surface hardness of the tooth enamel was then measured again (posttest) after 7 days of treatment. Results: The enamel surface hardness in group A (15% HA paste) (71.8±26.6) and group B (control) (-35.1±18.4). The results of statistical tests showed that there were significant differences between the treatment group and the control group. Conclusion: application of hydrocaispatite paste from catfish bone (Pangasius hypophthalmus) can increase the hardness of primary tooth enamel, while the group that was only soaked in artificial saliva did not experience an increase in the hardness of primary tooth enamel. \r\nKeywords: primary tooth enamel, hydroxyapatite, enamel hardness, pangasius hypophthalmus, precipitation.",

Musik klasik dilaporkan dapat meningkatkan laju alir karena memiliki nada yang tenang dan santai. Musik gamelan merupakan musik tradisional yang berasal dari indonesia dan memiliki harmoni lambat, nada selaras, dan rendah, namun pengaruhnya terhadap laju alir saliva belum pernah diteliti. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk membandingkan pengaruh musik klasik dengan musik gamelan terhadap laju alir saliva. Metode: Penelitian ini menggunakan studi pre-eksperimental dengan pendekatan post test only design yang melibatkan 20 subjek. Saliva akan dikumpulkan sebelum mendengarkan musik dengan metode spitting selama 5 menit. Subjek diberikan stimulus musik klasik dan musik gamelan masing-masing selama 10 menit kemudian saliva dikumpulkan kembali. Saliva yang dikumpulkan dicatat sebagai nilai laju alir saliva dengan satuan g/menit. Data dianalisis menggunakan uji Repeated Measures Anova dan Pairwise Comparison. Hasil: Hasil penelitian menunjukkan rata-rata laju alir saliva setelah mendengarkan musik baik  musik klasik maupun musik gamelan lebih tinggi dibandingkan sebelum mendengarkan musik (p<0,05). Tidak terdapat perbedaan yang signifikan antara musik klasik dan musik gamelan dalam meningkatkan laju alir saliva (p>0,05) Kesimpulan: Musik gamelan dapat meningkatkan laju alir saliva yang sama baiknya dengan musik klasik.\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground: Hyposalivation have negative effects on oral health, such as increasing the risk of dental caries. Therefore, salivary flow rate needs to be increased using auditory stimuli such as music. Classical music is reported can increase salivary flow rate because of its calm and relaxing tones. Gamelan music is a traditional music originating from Indonesia, known for its slow harmony, synchronized tones, and low pitch. However, its impact on salivary flow rate has not been studied. This research aims to compare the effects of classical music and gamelan music on salivary flow rate. Method: This study used a pre-experimental design with a post-test only approach involving 20 subjects. Saliva was collected before listening to music using the spitting method for 5 minutes. Subjects were exposed to classical music and gamelan music stimuli for 10 minutes each, and saliva were collected again. The collected saliva was recorded as the salivary flow rate in g/minute. Data were analyzed using Repeated Measures ANOVA and Pairwise Comparison. Results: The result showed that the average salivary flow rate after listening to both classical music and gamelan music was higher compared to before listening to music (p<0.05). There was no significant difference between classical music and gamelan music in increasing salivary flow rate (p>0.05). Conclusion : Gamelan music can increase saliva flow rate just as good as classical music.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Staphylococcus aureus is one of the opportunistic bacteria in the oral cavity that can cause various diseases, including periapical abscesses. The treatment of microbial infections needed to pay attention to selected antibiotics. Traditional medicine was very popular with the community because it had very minimal side effects and the availability that is easy to obtain. Suruhan leaves could be utilized as an antibacterial due to their content of tannins, saponins, flavonoids and alkaloids which inhibit bacterial growth. Purpose: This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of the antibacterial extract of suruhan leaves (Peperomia pellucida L) against Staphylococcus aureus. Methods: This study was an in vitro laboratory experimental study. The test group used an extract of suruhan leaf with concentrations of 20%, 40% and 60% obtained by the soxhlation method, clindamycin was used as a positive control and aquades as a negative control. The antibacterial potency was tested using the disc diffusion method to determine the value of the inhibition zone, the dilution method to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The inhibition zone values were then analyzed statistically using one-way ANOVA and Post-Hoc Tukey tests. Results: This study revealed that the 60% concentration of extract suruhan leaf had an average inhibition zone of 18.27 mm, but smaller than clindamycin. The MIC test results of extract suruhan leaf were determined at a concentration of 20% and MBC at 40%. Conclusion: Suruhan leaf extract (Peperomia pellucida L.) had antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus.\r\n\r\nKeywords: antibacterial, suruhan leaves, Peperomia Pellucida L, Staphylococcus aureus",

    "abstract": "Background: Dental anxiety refers to fear responses triggered by different factors, primarily dental procedures.  Among these procedures, tooth extraction is known to contribute to the development of dental anxiety in children. One effective approach to mitigate this anxiety involves using audio distraction techniques. These techniques involve using auditory stimuli to divert children's attention away from their anxiety. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the variation in dental anxiety levels among children before and after the application of audio distraction techniques, specifically in children undergoing primary teeth extraction at RSKGM Prov.Sumsel. Method: This study is a pre-experimental research utilizing a one-group pretest-posttest design, employing an incidental sampling method. The research was carried out on a cohort of 15 subjects scheduled for tooth extraction at RSKGM Prov.Sumsel. Anxiety levels were assessed before and after the implementation of audio distraction techniques, with observations recorded using the Child Anxiety Scales observation sheet. Results: The study findings revealed that the average anxiety level before implementing audio distraction was 3.67, indicating a relatively high level of anxiety (\"quite anxious\"). After the application of audio distraction techniques, the average anxiety level decreased to 1.67, with most individuals reporting a state of not being anxious. Concluson: Audio distraction techniques have a demonstrable impact on diminishing dental anxiety levels in children undergoing primary teeth extraction.",

    "abstract": "Background: A temporary soft liner (tissue conditioner) is typically material used as a temporary coating in cases of oral mucosal trauma caused by ill-fitting dentures. Soft liners are susceptible to contact with denture cleansing solutions, such as alkaline peroxide during clinical use. Continuous liquid penetration results in hydrolysis and dissolution of material constituents. The soft liner material's solubility may reduce its functionality. Thus, there is a necessity for alternative natural denture cleansers, that are antibacterial and antimicrobial, such as cinnamon extract. Aim: To evaluate the effect of time immersion in cinnamon extract (Cinnamomum burmannii) on the solubility of soft liner. Method: Twenty-four cylindrical soft liner samples, each measuring 15 mm x 2 mm, were used. The samples were divided into six groups: groups A and B were immersed in alkaline peroxide (for 7 and 14 days); groups C and D were immersed in 1.5% cinnamon extract (for 7 and 14 days); and groups E and F were immersed in distilled water (for 7 and 14 days). The solubility of the soft liner materials was evaluated by measuring the weight of the samples after 7 and 14 days of immersion. Data was analyzed using One-way ANOVA test and LSD Post Hoc test (p < 0.05). Result: The mean solubility was found highest in the group immersed in alkaline peroxide for 14 days and lowest in the group immersed in distilled water for 7 days. Additionally, there was a statistically significant difference observed among all the groups (p < 0.05). Conclusion: There was an affect found time immersion in 1,5% cinnamon extract solution on solubility of soft liner materials.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: GIC is one of the materials used for restorations. The advantages of GIC as a dental restoration are that it has a thermal expansion coefficient similar to a teeth and it can chemically bond with enamel and dentin and the disadvantages are that it is fracture-prone and brittle. CRGIC is a ceramic-reinforced GIC capable of providing hardness properties. Class II restorations are restorations found on the proximal surface of posterior teeth and there is a possibility of micro-leakage due to thin enamel. Objective: To compare micro-leakage of CRGIC and GIC in class II restorations. Methods: This research is an experimental study with a sample size of 24 maxillary premolars with class II cavities. Samples were divided into two groups, group 1 using CRGIC and group 2 using GIC. The samples were treated with manual thermocycling at 5ºC and 55ºC. Samples were immersed in 1% methylene blue solution for 24 hours. Teeth were cut using a separating disc. Microleakage was seen using a USB digital microscope with 100x magnification. The statistical test used was Mann-Whitney alternative test. Results: The average microleakage in groups 1 and 2 were 2.5 and 3.75. Data analysis using the Mann-Whitney alternative test showed a significant difference between the two groups of GIC and CRGIC (p<0.05) Conclusion: The micro-leakage value of CRGIC is lower than that of GIC and data analysis revealed that the difference in results is significant.",

Nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (Nc-HA) is the most frequently used alloplast material because of its composition and structural similarity to mineralized natural bone, its closer contact with surrounding tissues and can stimulate osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Purpose: This study aimed to determine the effect of nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite as a bone regenerating agent on reducing pocket depth and bone defect area in infrabony pocket. Materials and Methods: This research was systematic literature reflection with qualitative analysis of 10 journals. Results: The results showed that 10 journals had the same results regarding pocket depth collection, namely there was significant post-treatment of pocket depth using nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite and there were 9 journals which stated filling of the bone defect area and in 1 journal stated that there was an increase in post-treatment bone probing using nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite. Conclusion: Nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite is effective in reducing pocket depth and filling in bone defect area in infrabony pocket.\r\nKeywords: bone regeneration, infrabony pocket, nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite",

Bleeding during and after surgery is certainly a challenge for surgeons if it is not controlled. Curcuma longa extract can shorten the bleeding time because it contains curcumin and tannin. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of Curcuma longa extract on bleeding time in Wistar rats. Methods: Experimental study with post test only control group design. A total of 24 male wistar rats were divided into 4 groups, namely groups given tranexamic acid (positive control), distilled water (negative control), 50% concentration of Curcuma longa extract and 100% concentration of Curcuma longa extract. The treatment was given orally and only given once using a gastric sonde before the bleeding time test, then waited for 1 hour before cutting. All samples were cut along 0.5 cm from the tip of the rat's tail. Blood coming out of the tail tip was dripped on whatman paper with a time of 30 seconds per box until the bleeding stopped. Bleeding time was calculated by counting the number of boxes that had blood spots and multiplied by 30 seconds. The data obtained were then analyzed with the Independent sample t-test and Post Hoc Least Significant Difference (LSD) test. Results: The results of the study showed that the bleeding time of 100% turmeric extract was shorter than the 50% concentration of turmeric extract. . The difference in the mean value of bleeding time of tranexamic acid and curcuma longa was statistically significant (P<0.05). Conclusion: Curcuma longa extract at concentration of 50% and 100% can have an effect in shortening the bleeding time in wistar rats.\r\nKeywords: Hemostatic, Curcuma longa, Bleeding time",

    "abstract": "Background:Candy is a high-calorie food product, typically made with added sucrose, and if consumed excessively, it can lead to a decrease in saliva pH. A decrease in saliva pH causes the oral cavity to become acidic, facilitating the growth of bacteria, which in turn triggers cavities. To prevent a decrease in saliva pH, gambir extract is added to the candy. Gambir (Uncaria gambir Roxb.) is a herbal plant that contains flavonoid compounds such as catechins and tannins, which have antibacterial properties. This study aims to compare the saliva pH after consuming sucrose candy containing gambir extract and without gambir.Methods: An experimental study with a pretest-posttest with control group design was conducted, consisting of a sucrose candy group with gambir extract and a group without gambir. The research subjects were 32 students from the Part of Dentistry, Sriwijaya University. Saliva samples of 5 ml were collected before and after consuming the candy using the spitting method and measured using a digital pH meter. Paired t-tests and independent t-tests were performed to analyze the data. Results: This study showed that after consuming sucrose candy containing gambir extract, there was a significant increase in the average saliva pH compared to before consuming the candy (p < 0.05). Candy without gambir, after consumption, showed a significant decrease in saliva pH compared to the pH before consumption (p < 0.05). Conclusion:The group that consumed sucrose candies containing gambir extract (Uncaria gambir Roxb.) showed an increase in saliva pH compared to the group that consumed candies without gambir.\r\nKey words: gambir, candy, salivary pH, sucrose",

    "abstract": "Background: Instrumentation during root canal treatment will produce a smear layer. The irrigation functions to remove debris, pulp, microorganisms, smear layer, and necrotic tissue. Anatomical variations make the apical third of the root canal difficult to clean. The sonic agitation technique is effective in cleaning the smear layer in the apical third due to its large amplitude. NaOCl is an irrigant that is widely used because it has broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties, and can dissolve necrotic pulp and tissue, but can cause pain and inflammation if extruded periapically. An alternative irrigation material that can be used is ClO2 because it has broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties, low toxicity, and can dissolve organic and inorganic tissue. Objective: To determine the effectiveness of 0.3% ClO2 and the effectiveness of irrigation using the sonic agitation technique on the cleanliness of the smear layer in the apical third of the root canal. Methods: This in-vitro quasi-laboratory experimental study used 30 permanent mandibular premolars divided into 2 groups. Samples were prepared using the crown-down technique. The samples were irrigated according to the treatment group, namely group A was irrigated using 0.3% ClO2 with a sonic agitation technique, and group B was irrigated using 2.5% NaOCl with a sonic agitation technique. The samples were cut mesio-distally and the root canal cleanliness was assessed using a measuring microscope. The root canal cleanliness score was based on the cleanliness scale of Torabinejad et al. Data were analyzed using the Kappa statistical test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and Mann-Whitney test. Result: 0.3% ClO2 with the sonic agitation technique had a lower average cleanliness than 2.5% NaOCl with the sonic agitation technique, but the difference between the two was not significant (p = 0.051). Conclusion: 0.3% ClO2 solution with sonic agitation technique is effective in cleaning the apical third of the root canal.",

    "abstract": "Background: Streptococcus mutans is a Gram-positive bacteria that can convert fructose and lactic acid causing a decrease in pH. The acidic atmosphere that occurs due to a reduction in the mouth's pH can accelerate the growth of bacteria thereby increasing plaque formation in teeth. Chlorine dioxide is a chemical compound that can control plaque because it can raise the mouth's pH to inhibit the growth of bacteria in an acidic atmosphere of the mouth. Chlorine dioxide with a concentration of 0.3% is the highest concentration and is safe as a mouthwash. Objective: This study aims to determine the antibacterial effect of chlorine dioxide at a concentration of 0.3% in inhibiting the growth of Streptococcus mutans. Method: This research is an in vitro experimental laboratory study. The test group used chlorine dioxide with a concentration of 0.3%, a mouthwash containing fenol as a positive control and an aquades as a negative control. The disc diffusion method is carried out to determine the value of the inhibitory zone of chlorine dioxide against bacteria. The results of the inhibition zone measurement were statistically analyzed using the ANOVA one-way test and the Post Hoc LSD test. Results: The study showed that chlorine dioxide at 0,3% had a larger (22,88 mm) average inhibition zone than the positive control, namely mouthwash containing fenol (18,45 mm). Conclusion: Chlorine dioxide with a concentration of 0.3% has an antibacterial effect against Streptococcus mutans.",

    "abstract": "Background: Root canal treatment aims to eliminate bacteria and prevent recurring infections. Root canal disinfection remains a major challenge in root canal treatment and is a key factor in its success. Conventional disinfection methods are often less effective due to the complexity of root canal anatomy. The laser method is an evolving treatment approach for root canal disinfection, demonstrating greater effectiveness due to its ability to penetrate hard-to-reach areas and significantly reduce bacterial counts. The combination of laser and chemical disinfectants has proven more effective in enhancing the success of root canal treatment. Objective: This study aims to determine the effect of the laser method on root canal disinfection. Methods: A literature review was conducted using data from PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect over the past 10 years. The selected journals met inclusion and exclusion criteria, then were analyzed using CRIS and ARRIVE guidelines and summarized to gather data on the effect of the laser method on root canal disinfection in the reviewed journals. Results: This literature review successfully synthesized 18 journals discussing the impact of laser methods on root canal disinfection, with four different types of lasers and methods. Conclusion: The use of laser methods has been proven to be effective in enhancing root canal disinfection compared to conventional methods, significantly reducing pathogenic microorganisms. The efficacy of laser application is influenced by various parameters such as laser type, wavelength, power, and exposure time. Er:YAG and Er,Cr:YSGG lasers have shown the most promising results for disinfection, with Er:YAG offering superior deep cleaning and minimal damage to dentin, albeit at a higher cost and with limited penetration. While Er,Cr:YSGG is effective, it carries a higher risk of thermal effects. Diode lasers, on the other hand, are more affordable with deeper penetration but are less effective in activating irrigation solutions and may increase the risk of damaging surrounding tissues due to elevated temperatures.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Root canal treatment, LAI (Laser Activated Irrigation), Root canal disinfection",

    "abstract": "Background: Medical waste takes up a fairly large portion of the total waste on earth, where dental waste is in the form of hazardous and infectious materials. Some materials produced from dental practices, such as mercury from amalgam and various other chemicals, have the potential to harm humans and the environment. The Eco-Dentistry Association (EDA) has developed the Green Dentistry model of environmentally friendly dentistry and has 4 principles (Rethink, Reuse, Reduce, Recycle) that are environmentally conscious and health-based. These new emerging concepts in dentistry can reduce the environmental impact of dental practices in moving towards a sustainable healthcare system. From an architectural perspective, it can also be related to protecting the environment by implementing green buildings in dentist practice rooms. This movement is an effort by architects/developers to be wiser in managing buildings and the environment. This research aims to determine the application of Green Dentistry principles and green buildings in independent dental practice rooms in the city of Palembang. Method: This research uses a descriptive research design with a quantitative approach using survey methods. Results: The application of the rethink principle obtained a percentage of 43.9%, the reduce principle obtained the highest application percentage, namely 70.7%, the reuse principle obtained an application percentage of 68.3%, the recycle principle obtained an application percentage of 65.9%, while the green building criteria obtained the lowest implementation percentage was 24.4%. Conclusion: The overall results obtained can be concluded that the application of green dentistry principles in independent dental practice rooms in the city of Palembang has been implemented with a percentage of 85.4%.",

Continuous consumption of cuka pempek can affect the surface roughness of heat-cured acrylic resin denture bases due to its ability to absorb liquids. Objective: To determine the effect of the types of acid in cuka pempek on the surface roughness of heat-cured acrylic resin denture base. Method: Thirty heat cured acrylic resin plates measuring 65mm x 10mm x 2.5mm were divided into 3 groups. The initial surface roughness (pretest) was measured using a surface roughness tester. The plates were soaked in group I (cuka pempek with tamarind acid), group II (cuka pempek with acetic acid), and group III (control) with distilled water. Soaking was done for 30 hours in an incubator at 37°C. Final surface roughness measurements (post-test) were taken. Results: Normality test results using the Shapiro-Wilk test and homogeneity test using the Levene test indicated that the data were normally distributed and homogeneous. Paired t-tests showed significant differences in all groups. One-way ANOVA results indicated significant differences. The post hoc Bonferroni test results show a significant difference between cuka pempek based on tamarind and based on acetic acid in relation to aquadest, whereas there is no significant difference between cuka pempek based on tamarind and based on acetic acid.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Gingivitis is an inflammatory condition that involves the soft tissue around the teeth (gingiva). The main factor causing gingivitis in children and adolescents is the accumulation of bacterial deposits on the teeth and gingival sulcus. One of the bacteria that cause gingivitis is the bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis. Chlorhexidine is commonly used as the gold standard for preventing gingivitis, but it can cause side effects such as brown discoloration of teeth, impaired taste, and irrtitaion of mucosa. Miana leaves are natural ingredients that are often used as alternative medicines due to their antibacterial effects because they contain flavonoids, tannins, alkaloids, saponins, and essential oils. This study aims to determine the antibacterial effectiveness of miana leaf extract against Porphyromonas gingivalis bacteria. Material & Methods: The study used miana leaves for laboratory experimental research. There were five treatment groups consisting of 20%, 40%, and 60% concentration of miana leaf extract. 0.2% chlorhexidine as a positive control, and aquadest as a negative control. The inhibition zone test was carried out using the disc diffusion method and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) tests using the solid dilution method. Result: There was a significant difference between all treatment groups (p<0.05). The inhibition zone had the largest diameter of 16.16 mm at a 60% concentration, which was smaller than the 22.22 mm diameter of the 0.2% chlorhexidine. The MIC was obtained at 20% concentration and the MBC was obtained at 40% concentration. Conclusion: Miana leaf extract had an antibacterial effect against Porphyromonas gingivalis bacteria.",

These microorganisms can cause various\r\ndiseases in the oral cavity, including abscesses, gingivitis, mucositis, parotitis, angular cheilitis, and denture stomatitis. The use of chlorhexidine can overcome this, but it can cause side effects. This problem can be overcome by using alternative traditional ingredients derived from plants which have antibacterial properties. One plant that has been widely used by the community as a traditional medicinal plant is cloves (Syzygium aromaticum). Clove flowers are a plant that can be used as an antibacterial because they contain a high compound in the form of eugenol which can inhibit bacterial growth. The\r\naim of this research was to determine the antibacterial power of clove flower infusion (Syzygium aromaticum) against the growth of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Methods: This research is an in vitro experimental laboratory research. The test group used clove flower infusion with concentrations of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% obtained through the infusion method.

    "abstract": "Background: Canine impaction tooth is a condition when a tooth cannot erupt completely in accordance with its eruption time. Maxillary canines are the most commonly impacted teeth after third molars. Confirming the diagnosis of canine tooth impaction requires supporting examinations in the form of radiographic examinations, one of which is the panoramic radiography technique. Panoramic radiography can be used as an initial examination to detect the impaction of canine teeth because it can provide an overall picture of the teeth. Research on canine tooth impaction is still very limited, while information and understanding of the position and direction of canine tooth impaction are needed to plan appropriate odontectomy actions. Objective: This study was aims to determine the prevalence of impaction of maxillary and mandibular canines on panoramic radiographic examination at the RSKGM South Sumatra Province in 2021-2023. Methods: This study is a descriptive observational study conducted on June 05-25, 2024, at the RSKGM South Sumatra Province. Samples were taken using purposive sampling, totaling 1,715 patient panoramic radiographs. Data were analyzed using the SPSS program. Results: There were 46 panoramic radiographs of patients who had impaction of canine teeth out of 1,715 panoramic radiographs.Impaction was found more in female than male patients (65.2%), the most age was 15-24 years (65.2%), the location of impaction was more in the upper jaw than the lower jaw (77.6%), the most maxillary canine tooth impaction was found to be type II, and the most mandibular canine impaction was found at level C with horizontal direction. Conclusion: The prevalence of canine teeth impaction found at the RSKGM South Sumatra Province in 2021-2023 based on panoramic radiographs, was found to be 2.6%.",

    "abstract": "Background: Premolar impaction is often found in dental practice, especially in the second premolar of the mandible after the third molar and canine. Premolar teeth in the mandible are reported to have a higher prevalence rate than in the maxilla, which is 24% of all impaction cases. The choice of impaction treatment plan generally depends on the position of the impacted tooth, the developmental stage of the impacted tooth, the distance from the impacted tooth to the occlusal plane, the relationship of the impacted tooth to the adjacent teeth, and the need for orthodontic treatment. Treatment options for premolar impaction include observation and intervention. Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the management of premolar tooth impaction in fixed orthodontic treatment. Method: The type of research to be conducted is a qualitative literature review of 22 case report journals. Research results: Research results from 22 journals showed that premolar tooth impaction was most commonly found in female patients aged 10-23 years, on tooth 35 or the second left premolar of the mandible and the impaction angle was vertical. Management of premolar tooth impaction was most commonly performed with a combination of deciduous tooth extraction with orthodontic treatment compared to a combination of surgical exposure or corticotomy with orthodontic treatment, premolar tooth impaction extraction or autotransplantation. Conclusion: Management of premolar tooth impaction was most commonly performed with a combination of deciduous tooth extraction with orthodontic treatment compared to a combination of surgical exposure or corticotomy with orthodontic treatment, premolar tooth impaction extraction or autotransplantation.",

    "abstract": "Background: Candy is a processed food in the form of a solid and if consumed excessively it will reduce the salivary pH which is one of the factors causing caries. This decrease occurs due to the activity of acid-producing bacteria in the oral cavity. Preventing a decrease in salivary pH can be done by adding gambir and xylitol to candy. Gambir is a herbal ingredient containing catechins and tannins which act as antibacterial agents. Xylitol is a natural ingredient that can inhibit the growth of acid-producing bacteria in the oral cavity. This study aims to determine the effect of consuming gambir candy sweetened with sucrose and candy sweetened with xylitol on salivary pH. Method: Experimental research with a pre-post test control group design approach consisting of a gambir candy group sweetened with sucrose and a group of sweets sweetened with xylitol. The subject of this study were 32 students of BKGM FK UNSRI. Sample of 5 ml saliva was taken before and after consuming candy using the spitting method. Salivary pH was measured with a digital pH meter. The data were analyzed by paired t-test and unpaired t-test. Results: This study showed that after consuming gambir candy sweetened with sucrose and candy sweetened with xylitol, there was a significant increase in the average salivary pH compared to before consuming the candy (p<0.05). Candy sweetened with xylitol showed a higher increase in salivary pH and was significantly different from gambir candy with the addition of sucrose (p<0.05). Conclusion: Consuming gambir candy with sucrose sweetener and candy with xylitol sweetener has an effect in maintaining salivary pH within normal limits.",

    "abstract": "Background: Tooth extraction is one of the procedures in dentistry when the condition of the teeth can no longer be maintained with conservation treatment. This action will cause tooth socket wounds. When a wound occurs, physiologically it will be followed by a wound healing process through several phases, namely the hemostasis phase, inflammation phase, proliferation phase, and remodeling phase. Sumbawa forest honey contains flavonoids and saponins that can help accelerate the healing process of tooth socket wounds. Purpose: This study aims to determine the effect of 100% Sumbawa forest honey on the healing of tooth socket wounds in Wistar strain rats. Method: The type of research is an experimental laboratory with a posttest only control group design. 27 male Wistar rats were used as research samples and divided into 3 groups, namely the negative group (aquades), the 100% Sumbawa forest honey group, and the positive group (aloclair) which was given 2 times a day for 7 days. The average wound size was calculated using a Digital calliper and analyzed using the One Way Anova test and the Post Hoc Least Significant Difference (LSD) test. Results: The results of this study indicate that the Sumbawa forest honey group with a concentration of 100% is effective in helping the healing process of tooth socket wounds. Statistically, the treatment group has a significant difference (p <0.05) compared to the aloclair treatment group, and the control group with aquades. Conclusion: Based on the results of the study, it can be concluded that Sumbawa forest honey with a concentration of 100% is effective in healing tooth socket wounds in wistar strain rats compared to aloclair.",

Purple sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) has potential as a disclosing solution due to its anthocyanin content, which provides color and antioxidant properties. Objective: to determine the effectiveness of purple sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) extract as a disclosing solution for identifying dental plaque in children aged 11-12 years. Methods: A quasi experimental study with a post-test control group design was conducted on 48 students from Muhammadiyah 14 Elementary School in Palembang. The subjects were divided into three groups: 12% purple sweet potato extract, 16% purple sweet potato extract, and erythrosine as a positive control. All subjects underwent the same pre-treatment, which involved consuming biscuits and UHT milk followed by a 2-hour fasting period. The Patient Hygiene Performance (PHP) plaque index was then measured and statistically analyzed using a one-way ANOVA test. Results: The average PHP plaque index for the 12% purple sweet potato extract group was 0.88, while the 16% group had an average index of 1.47. Both were lower compared to the erythrosine control group, which had an average index of 2.30. The one-way ANOVA analysis revealed significant differences (p<0.05) between the groups. Conclusion: Purple sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) extract at concentrations of 12% and 16% is not effective as a disclosing solution for identifying dental plaque in children aged 11-12 years.",

The prevention of microorganism proliferation is essential to address failures in root canal treatments caused by Enterococcus faecalis. Beetroot (Beta vulgaris L.) is known to contain antibacterial compounds such as flavonoids, which are proven effective in inhibiting bacterial growth and killing various bacterial species. Objective: To evaluate the antibacterial effect of beetroot extract against Enterococcus faecalis. Methods: This study employed an in vitro laboratory experimental design with a post-test-only control group approach. Beetroot extracts with concentrations of 12,500 μg/ml, 25,000 μg/ml, 50,000 μg/ml, and 100,000 μg/ml were tested. The negative control group used aquadest, while 2.5% NaOCl served as the positive control. The disc diffusion method was applied to assess the inhibition zone, followed by Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) tests using a colony count method. Data were analyzed using post hoc Mann-Whitney Results: Beetroot extract at concentrations of 12,500 μg/ml and 25,000 μg/ml (p<0.05) effectively inhibited the growth of Enterococcus faecalis. At a concentration of 50,000 μg/ml (p<0,5), the extract exhibited bactericidal activity against Enterococcus faecalis. Conclusion: The inhibition zone test indicated that beetroot extract demonstrated inhibitory effects against Enterococcus faecalis. The colony count results confirmed that beetroot extract exhibited bactericidal activity against Enterococcus faecalis.",

    "title": "AKTIVITAS ANTIBAKTERI HIDROLISAT KOLAGEN TULANG IKAN TENGGIRI (SCOMBEROMORUS COMMERSON) TERHADAP BAKTERI ENTEROCOCCUS FAECALIS",
    "abstract": "In cases of persistent endodontic infection, 20 out of 30 cases were found with Enterococcus faecalis bacteria. This bacteria is also the main pathogen that is still often found in cases after endodontic treatment with a case prevalence of 30% to 90% so it must be removed with antibacterial irrigation solutions. However, root canal irrigation solutions are generally chemical-based and have side effects. Mackerel bone with hydrolyzed collagen has potential as an alternative antibacterial material.The purpose of this study was to determine the antibacterial activity of Scomberomorus commerson fish bone collagen hydrolysate against Enterococcus faecalis. This research is an in vitro laboratory study. Collagen was extracted with acid solution, followed by hydrolysis process using bromelain enzyme with different hydrolysis time treatments, namely 60 minutes, 90 minutes, and 120 minutes. The antibacterial power test against Enterococcus faecalis was carried out with a disc diffusion test to determine the diameter of the inhibition zone. The positive control in this study was 2% chlorhexidine. The highest average diameter of the inhibition zone was shown by the 2% chlorhexidine as a positive control group of 20.04 mm, followed by the hydrolysis time groups of 120 minutes, 90 minutes, and 60 minutes. The longer hydrolysis time, the greater the diameter of the inhibition zone formed. Hydrolyzed Scomberomorus commerson fish bone collagen with hydrolysis time of 60 minutes, 90 minutes, and 120 minutes has antibacterial power against Enterococcus faecalis.",

    "abstract": "Background: Class I malocclusion is the most common malocclusion type worldwide, with a reported prevalence of approximately 61% among adolescents aged 13-15 years. In Indonesia, it ranks third among oral and dental health problems. Malocclusion treatment often used in Indonesia is a fixed orthodontic appliance as much as 81.5%. However, fixed appliances have limitations in terms of aesthetics and comfort. As a result, clear aligners have emerged as an alternative treatment option, offering potential improvements in these areas. Objective: To compare orthodontic treatment using clear aligners and fixed orthodontics in class I malocclusion. Methods: This narrative review was conducted using data from Google Scholar, PubMed, and ResearchGate for the past 10 years (June 2015 - August 2025). Results: A total of 13 journals were analyzed. Four studies reported no statistically significant differences in Peer Assessment Rating (PAR) scores between clear aligner therapy and fixed orthodontic treatment. Two studies indicated that patients undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment experienced higher Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores, reflecting greater discomfort, compared to those treated with clear aligners. Three studies found that clear aligner therapy was associated with reduced root resorption relative to fixed appliances. Additionally, two studies reported improved periodontal tissue conditions in patients treated with clear aligners. Finally, two studies indicated that the overall treatment duration was shorter with clear aligners than with fixed orthodontic appliances. Conclusion: Both clear aligner and fixed orthodontic treatments can treat class I malocclusion cases.",

One potential source of alternative antibiotics is duck eggshell waste (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus), which contains calcium carbonate that has antimicrobial activity. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the characteristics of duck eggshell calcined CaO and test its antibacterial effectiveness against P. aeruginosa. Methods: Eggshells were heated through calcination process at three temperature levels: 600°C, 800°C, and 1000°C. Compound characterization was carried out using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), while the antibacterial activity test was carried out in vitro by disc diffusion method to measure the growth inhibition zone of P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027. Results: The sample with calcination treatment at 1000°C showed the largest inhibition zone diameter, indicating the highest antibacterial power. XRD tests confirmed that increasing the calcination temperature was directly proportional of the resulting calcium oxide (CaO). Conclusion: Duck eggshell calcined at high temperature has potential as a natural antibacterial material that is effective against P. aeruginosa, and has the opportunity to be applied in the health field, especially dentistry.",

    "abstract": "Latar belakang: Ektraksi gigi merupakan tindakan perawatan yang dapat menyebabkan luka berupa soket terbuka. Proses penyembuhan luka terdiri dari beberapa fase dan melibatkan berbagai sel, salah satunya sel fibroblas. Fibroblas berperan penting dalam proses penyembuhan luka pada fase proliferasi. Bunga cengkeh memiliki kandungan seperti eugenol, flavonoid, saponin, dan tanin yang berpotensi dalam meningkatkan fibroblas dan mempercepat proses penyembuhan luka. Tujuan: Mengetahui efektivitas ekstrak bunga cengkeh konsentrasi 60% terhadap jumlah fibroblas pada penyembuhan luka pasca ekstraksi gigi tikus Wistar. Metode: Jenis penelitian adalah eksperimental laboratorium dengan desain penelitian post test control group. 28 ekor tikus jantan Wistar dibagi menjadi 4 kelompok. Setelah gigi insisivus mandibula diekstraksi, soket pada kelompok 1 dan 3 diaplikasikan gel ekstrak bunga cengkeh 60% dan asam hialuronat sebanyak 2 kali sehari selama 3 hari, lalu kelompok 2 dan 4  diaplikasikan gel ekstrak bunga cengkeh 60% dan asam hialuronat sebanyak 2 kali sehari selama 7 hari. Jumlah fibroblas dihitung menggunakan software Olympus dan dianalisis menggunakan uji independent sample t-test. Hasil: Hasil penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa asam hialuronat memiliki nilai rata-rata jumlah sel fibroblas yang lebih tinggi dibandingkan kelompok perlakuan gel ekstrak bunga cengkeh konsentrasi 60% baik selama 3 hari maupun selama 7 hari. Namun, uji independent sample t-test menunjukkan tidak adanya perbedaan yang signifikan antara kelompok perlakuan dan kontrol positif (p>0,05). Kesimpulan: Pemberian gel ekstrak bunga cengkeh konsentrasi 60% efektif dalam meningkatkan jumlah sel fibroblas pada luka pasca ekstraksi gigi tikus Wistar pada hari ke 3 dan hari ke-7.",

The selection of cementation materials for FPD significantly influences the success and durability of the prosthesis. Key characteristics such as shear strength (SBS), tensile strength (TBS), compressive strength, and microleakage are evaluated to determine the retention of FPD. The aim of this literature review is to analyze the characteristics of luting cements in determining the ideal cementation materials for FPD. This literature review study with a qualitative analysis using PUBMED, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar data over the past 15 years. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to select relevant studies followed by bias assessment using Checklist for Reporting In-vitro Studies (CRIS). This study synthesized twenty one in vitro studies. Sixteen studies reported that resin cement has the highest retention. Ten studies stated that zinc phosphate (ZP), zinc polycarboxylate (ZPC), glass ionomer cement (GIC), and resin cement provide good retention for all-metal FPD. Six studies indicated that resin cement demonstrates good retention for all-ceramic FPD. Four studies reported that resin cement also exhibits good retention for porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM) FPD. Resin cement exhibits superior characteristics, making it the ideal cementation material for FPD. ZP, ZPC, and GIC exhibit favorable characteristics performance and are considered ideal luting agents for all-metal FPD. RMGIC exhibits inferior performance in FPD cementation.",

    "abstract": "Background: Endo-perio lesion primarily caused by endodontic and periodontal are the most commonly encountered conditions. The success of endo-perio lesion treatment depends on efficient disinfection and optimal root canal sealing. The development of calcium silicate based or bioceramic sealer is based on sealers with good biocompatibility, which promotes the formation of mineralized tissue and suitable physical properties. The biocompatibility of bioceramic sealer can affect cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis. Bioceramic sealer can stimulate osteogenesis and can increase cell viability. Objective: This study aims to determine the effect of endodontic bioceramic sealer on the healing of endo-perio lesion. Methods: The type of research was a literature review using qualitative analysis of case report journals using PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar database for the 10 years based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, and followed by bias assessment using the CARE (Case Report Statement and Checklist. Results: The results showed that 9 journals had the same results on the use of bioceramic sealers in endo-perio lesions. The healing of endo-perio lesions is characterized by a reduction in pocket depth, alveolar bone repair, normal periodontal ligament space, reattachment of clinical attachment, and the healing of the sinus tract around apex. Conclusion: The use of endodontic bioceramic sealers may affect the healing of endo-perio lesions.",

The level of dental and oral health problems of children with special\r\nneeds is higher than normal children, reaching 83.92%. One group of children with special needs is deaf children. Ignoring oral health behavior is generally motivated by limited knowledge about proper oral health maintenance efforts. Ways to improve oral health knowledge can be done by counseling about oral health. Counseling using image media such as leaflets is considered effective in increasing knowledge in deaf children. Objective: To determine the effect of oral health counseling on children's knowledge before and after being given leaflet media counseling on oral health in SLB Karya Ibu Palembang children. Methods: This type of research is a pseudo experiment with one group pretest-posttest design. The research subjects were 30 deaf children aged 6-12 years at SLB Karya Ibu Palembang. Knowledge was assessed using questionnaire administered before and after the education session. Data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon test. Results: There was a significant difference between pretest and posttest scores after the leaflet intervention, with a p-value of 0.001 (p<0.05).Conclusion: Leaflet-based dental health education\r\nsignificantly improved the knowledge of deaf children.",

    "abstract": "Stunted is a state of malnutrition in toddlers due to an imbalance between nutritional needs and nutrient intake. Stunted in toddlers can cause developmental disorders of the oral cavity structures, leading to a decrease in pH, Salivary Flow Rate (SFR), and buffer capacity. Efforts that can be made to prevent the decrease in pH and SFR by providing a remineralization agent, Phosphopeptide-Amorphous Calcium \r\nPhosphate (CPP-ACP). CPP-ACP is a bioactive material derived from casein protein in milk that inhibits demineralization and enhances the resistance of teeth to acid, by forming \r\nmineral deposits, Ca2+, and PO43-. Objective: To determine the changes in pH and LAS after the application of CPP-ACP for 7 and 14 days in stunted toddlers. Methods: The type of research used is quasi-experimental with a pre-test and post-test design. The sampling technique used was purposive sampling, with subjects of 30 people. All subjects \r\nwere given the same treatment, which was the application of CPP-ACP twice a day for 14 days. The research subjects will have their pH and SFR measured three times; before the \r\ntreatment, 7 days after the treatment, and 14 days after the treatment. The research data were obtained through the Shapiro Wilk normality test. The data distribution of the group is normal, the testing will use a parametric test (Paired sample t-test). Results: The results of the Paired sample t-test analysis showed significant change on the saliva pH and SFR of stunted toddlers after application CPP-ACP for 14 days.Conclusion: The use of CPPACP with topical application twice a day for 14 days can increase the pH and salivary flow rate.",

    "abstract": "Background: Dental caries remains a prevalent oral health issue in Indonesia, with Streptococcus mutans identified as the main causative agent. While 0.2% chlorhexidine is effective, its side effects highlight the need for natural alternatives. Green tea (Camellia sinensis. L) contains antibacterial compounds like catechins and flavonoids. Objective: To evaluate the antibacterial effectiveness of green tea leaf extract from Pagar Alam against Streptococcus mutans. Methods: This in vitro true experimental study used a post-test only control group design with the disk diffusion method. Samples consisted of green tea extract at concentrations of 5%, 15%, and 25%, and a 0.2% chlorhexidine control. Inhibition zones were measured with a caliper and analyzed using One Way ANOVA and Post Hoc LSD tests. Results: The average inhibition zone diameters were 5.900 mm (5%), 7.908 mm (15%), and 10.033 mm (25%). The positive control showed 16.700 mm. Significant differences were observed among all groups (p<0.05). Conclusion: Green tea leaf extract from Pagar Alam can inhibit significantly the growth of Streptococcus mutans, with increasing antibacterial activity at higher concentrations. The 25% concentration yielded the highest inhibitory effect compared to the other concetrations. However, grean tea leaf extract from Pagar Alam is still not effective as antibacterial compared to CHX 0,2%.",

Compressive strength is an important mechanical property that needs to be tested because most masticatory force is compressive strength. Flowable composite has been developed to achieve better mechanical and aesthetic properties. Various types of fillers have been developed, one of which is adding fluoride. Fluoride addition has been proven to prevent \r\nsecondary caries, however its effect on the compressive strength of flowable composite still requires further research. To compare the compressive strength of conventional flowable composite and fluoride-based flowable composite.This study is a laboratory experimental study with posttest-only control group design. Samples were moulded using a stainless-steel split mold with 3 mm diameter and 6 mm thickness. Twenty samples were divided into two groups, conventional flowable composite group and fluoride-based flowable composite group. The samples were filled using the incremental technique and light cured with intensity 1400 mW/cm2 LED for 10 second. Samples were finished using composite polishing disc and compressive strength was tested with a universal testing machine. Data analysis using Shapiro-Wilk test, Levene's Test of Variance, and Independent T-Test.  The average value of compressive strength conventional flowable composite is 373.14 MPa and fluoride-based flowable composite is 280.20 MPa.

    "abstract": "Background: Thermoplastic nylon is a material that is flexible, has good esthetics, and is used as an alternative for individuals who are allergic to residual resin monomers and metals. However, thermoplastic nylon has a high water absorption rate, which affects its  color stability. Color stability is one of the most important clinical properties in dentistry. One factor that can influence the color stability of thermoplastic nylon is coffee. Coffee is  a widely consumed beverage today, including in South Sumatra. The compounds present in Robusta coffee have a high potential to cause staining compared to other types of coffee. Objective: This study aimed to determine the effect of robusta coffee and immersion duration on the color stability of thermoplastic nylon denture base. Method: This study was a laboratory experimental research with pre-test and post-test group design. A total of 32 thermoplastic nylon sampels measuring 20mm x 3mm were divided into 8 group, which were 4 groups immersed in robusta coffee and the other 4 groups immersed in aquadest for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days. Color stability was measured by colorimeter. The statistical tests were Paired t-test, One Way-Anova, and Post hoc LSD. Result: The paired T-test results showed that each group had significant color changes in the degree of dark-light (∆L). The highest mean color change was found in the group immersed in robusta coffee for 7 days (mean=14.25), while the lowest color change was in the group immersed in aquadest for 1 day (mean=9.68). Conclusion: Robusta coffee can affect the color stability of thermoplastic nylon and the longer the immertion time in robusta coffee, the greater the degree of color change.

Conventional flowable composite resins formed micromechanical bonds through an adhesive system and had no anticariogenic ability. The addition of fluoride to flowable composite resins provided anticariogenic properties that helped prevent secondary caries. Objective: To compare the shear bond strength of conventional flowable composite resin and fluorinated flowable composite resin on dentin. Method: The 20 maxillary premolar teeth were cleaned and stored in distilled water at 4°C until use. The mesial surface of the teeth was marked 2 mm above the cementoenamel junction as the preparation depth. After acrylic resin fixation, dentin surfaces were etched and bonded. Samples were randomly divided into two groups: group A (conventional flowable composite resin, n = 10) and group B (fluorinated flowable composite resin, n = 10). Both groups were filled, cured, finished, and polished. After 24 hours of water storage, samples were dried and tested for shear bond strength using a universal testing machine. Data were analyzed using the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality, the Levene test for homogeneity, and the Mann-Whitney test for statistical significance. Result: The mean value of shear bond strength of conventional flowable composite resin was 16,1250 MPa and fluorinated flowable composite resin was 15,7010 MPa. The Mann-Whitney test analysis (P = 0,441) showed no significant difference between the two groups. Conclusion: There was no significant difference between the shear bond strength of conventional flowable composite resin and fluorinated flowable composite resin on dentin.",

    "title": "UJI FORMULASI LARUTAN PEMBERSIH EKSTRAK KAYU MANIS (CINNAMOMUM BURMANII) TERHADAP BASIS GIGI TIRUAN AKRILIK",
    "abstract": "Background: Cinnamon (Cinnamomum burmanii) based herbal denture cleansers has been widely studied in previous research. The results showed that cinnamon has minimal effects on the mechanical properties of acrylic resin, including impact strength, transverse strength, and surface roughness, while still demonstrating effectiveness in inhibiting microorganisms. Based on these findings, further development was carried out through the formulation and physical evaluation stages of the denture cleanser solution. Aim: The purpose of this study was to identify a stable and safe formulation of a denture cleansing solution containing cinnamon extract (Cinnamomum burmanii). This development was conducted as an innovation to utilize herbal ingredients as denture cleansers, which are expected to be applicable for community use. Materials and Methods: Formulations were prepared with three concentrations: FI (1%), FII (2%), and FIII (3%). The study stages included: (1) collection of cinnamon bark, (2) preparation of cinnamon extract, (3) formulation of denture cleanser solution, (4) physical evaluations including organoleptic, pH test, density, and viscosity, and (5) data analysis. Data were presented descriptively in tables and narratives. Results: All formulations showed a yellow color with a distinctive aroma and varying intensity, clear solution appearance, as well as density and viscosity values that met the quality requirements for physical stability. The pH value of formulation FIII on day 14 was found to be outside the expected range. Conclusion: The 1% cinnamon extract formulation (FI) showed a greater pH decrease compared to the 2% (FII) and 3% (FIII) formulations. All formulations exhibited viscosity values above 3 cP, approaching the expected range, and fulfilled the physical quality requirements. However, FIII is unsuitable for long-term use as its pH was found to be outside the acceptable range.",

Untreated carious lesions can lead to extensive tooth structure damage and require invasive procedures. Prevention and management of carious lesions on the occlusal surface can be achieved by applying pit and fissure sealants, one of which is a resin-based fissure sealant. Objective: To determine the effectiveness of resin-based pit and fissure sealant in preventing the formation and halting the progression of carious lesions through a literature review. Methods: This study is a literature review with qualitative analysis. Journals obtained through Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect databases were selected, and then bias analysis and data extraction were conducted. Results: This study utilized 9 randomized controlled trial journals and 4 cohort study journals. Seven journals concluded that resin-based pit and fissure sealants effectively prevent the formation and halt the progression of caries, as well as are superior to glass ionomer sealants. One journal identified differences in effectiveness among types of resin-based pit and fissure sealants. And five journals found comparable effectiveness between resin-based sealants and glass ionomer sealants or fluoride varnish. Conclusion: Resin-based pit and fissure sealants are effective in preventing caries in individuals at high risk and halting the progression of individuals with early non-cavitated occlusal caries. The retention of the sealant on the tooth surface influences the effectiveness of resin-based pit and fissure sealants in preventing the formation and halting the progression of caries.",

    "abstract": "Latar belakang: C. albicans merupakan flora normal pada manusia, yang biasanya ditemukan di rongga mulut, saluran cerna, vagina, dan kulit. Populasi C. albicans ditemukan di rongga mulut manusia sekitar 35%-80%. Sehingga diperlukan perawatan dan pengobatan dengan menggunakan obat antijamur yaitu nystatin. Namun, penggunaan dari obat antijamur nystatin dapat memberikan efek samping. Tulang ikan patin merupakan salah satu jenis ikan yang hidrolisat kolagennya memiliki potensi sebagai bahan alternatif antijamur. Tujuan: Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui aktivitas antijamur hidrolisat kolagen tulang ikan patin terhadap C. albicans. Metode: Penelitian ini merupakan penelitian laboratorium in vitro, dimana kolagen diekstraksi dengan larutan asam, dilanjutkan dengan proses hidrolisis menggunakan enzim papain dengan perlakuan waktu hidrolisis yang berbeda-beda, yakni 60 menit, 90 menit, dan 120 menit. Uji daya antijamur terhadap C. albicans dilakukan dengan uji difusi sumuran untuk mengetahui diameter zona hambat. Kontrol positif pada penelitian ini nystatin. Hasil: Zona hambat yang terbentuk hanya terdapat pada kontrol positif, yaitu nystatin dengan rata-rata zona hambat sebesar 18,79 mm. Kesimpulan: Hidrolisat kolagen tulang ikan patin (Pangasius hypopthalmus) dengan waktu hidrolisis 60 menit, 90 menit, dan 120 menit tidak dapat menghambat pertumbuhan C. albicans.",

    "abstract": "Background: Fluoride is a material commonly found in green vegetables, legumes, fish, potatoes, and in products to which fluoride was added such as toothpaste, mouthwash, and fluoride-containing restorative materials. The incorporation of fluoride into restorative materials such as glass ionomer cement (GIC) and fluoride-containing flowable composite resin was intended to allow those materials to release fluoride continuously. This fluoride release functioned to prevent plaque formation and inhibit secondary caries by assisting in tooth remineralization. Aims: To compare fluoride ion release from GIC and fluoride-containing flowable composite resin. Methods: A comparative in vitro laboratory study with a repeated-measures (within-subject) and between-subject design was conducted. Five circular specimens of GIC and fluoride-containing flowable composite resin, prepared according to ISO #7489, were suspended in 20 mL of distilled water. Fluoride release was measured on day-1, day-7, day-15, day-21, and day-28 using a colorimeter. Data were analyzed using independent t-tests and One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc correction. Results: GIC released significantly more fluoride ions than the fluoride-containing flowable composite resin on day-1, day-7, and day-15, while no differences in fluoride release were observed on day-21 and day-28. Both GIC and the fluoride-containing flowable composite resin exhibited the same release pattern, characterized by a surge on day-1 followed by a sharp decline. Conclusion: GIC released more fluoride ions than the fluoride-containing flowable composite resin. The fluoride-containing flowable composite resin demonstrated a fluoride release pattern similar to that of GIC.",

    "abstract": "Background: According to Riskesdas 2018, malocclusion was the third most common oral and dental condition in Indonesia, with a prevalence of 80%. The highest incidence was found among children aged 12–15 years (15.6%). One of the methods used to treat malocclusion was the use of fixed orthodontic appliances. A total of 81.50% of adolescents were users of fixed orthodontic appliances. However, their use was not always intended to align the teeth, but was also influenced by perceptions of appearance as part of a trend or lifestyle. Objective: To determine the perception of fixed orthodontic treatment among tenth-grade students at SMA Negeri 10 Palembang. Methods: This observational study employed a questionnaire consisting of 17 items distributed via Google Forms to a sample of 432 students. Results: A total of 363 students (84.02%) showed a moderate level of perception, influenced by the high cost of treatment and a lack of understanding regarding the competence of the operator. Conclusion: The high cost of orthodontic treatment, which poses an economic burden, along with the perception that there is no significant difference in treatment outcomes between operators, are key factors hindering the development of a positive perception of fixed orthodontic care.",

    "abstract": "Background: Enamel is the outermost and hardest tissue covering the crown of the\r\ntooth. Tooth enamel consists of 95% inorganic components in the form of\r\nhydroxyapatite crystals, such as calcium and phosphate, and the rest are organic\r\ncomponents. If these components are lost, it is called demineralization. The\r\ndemineralization process causes porosity, resulting in roughness on the tooth\r\nsurface. Tooth surface roughness can be repaired by the remineralization process.\r\nThe remineralization process occurs when the acidic pH of the oral cavity is\r\nneutralized by adding herbal ingredients to gambir toothpaste as an alternative.\r\nObjective: This study aims to determine the effect of gambir toothpaste on tooth\r\nsurface roughness. Methods: Ten premolar tooth crowns were divided into 2\r\ngroups: Group A (Gambir toothpaste), Group B (control). The initial tooth surface\r\nroughness value was measured using a Surface Roughness Tester after the\r\ndemineralization process with 37% phosphoric acid etching. The samples were\r\nbrushed for 2 minutes twice a day for 14 days, then soaked in artificial saliva and\r\nstored in an incubator at 37ºC. Then, it was measured again using a Surface\r\nRoughness Tester. Statistical tests used the Paired t-test and Independent t-test.\r\nResults: Paired t-test results showed a significant increase in tooth enamel\r\nroughness in each group. Independent t-test results showed no significant\r\ndifference in tooth surface roughness after demineralization and after brushing\r\nbetween groups. Conclusion: Gambir toothpaste has an effect in reducing tooth\r\nsurface roughness, but there is no significant difference when compared with\r\nplacebo toothpaste.\r\nKey words: Tooth surface roughness, gambir toothpaste, placebo toothpaste.",

    "abstract": "Background: Scaffold is a material serves as a place to attach cells and growth factors to mimic the structure of extracellular matrix (ECM), so that it can help restore the function of damaged tissues. Based on their raw materials, scaffolds are divided into two: natural and synthetic. Research continues to be conducted to make plants as scaffolds alternatives as their structure resembles body tissue and retains its shape after the decellularization process. One of these plants is gambier leaves. Gambier leaves have a pore-like structure, similar to porous scaffolds and trabecular bone. The microporosity in scaffolds plays an important role in aiding cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation. Objective: To determine the microporosity of post-decellularized gambier leaves as a scaffold using detergent method. Method: Gambier leaves were cleaned, stored at -20°C, then cut using a biopsy punch. The samples were immersed in 10% Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) solution for 5 days, washed with distilled water, and immersed in Tween 20 and NaClO solutions that were changed every 24 hours until the leaves became transparent. The leaves were washed again, immersed in fixation solution overnight, and then dehydrated gradually with ethanol of several different consentration. Samples were dripped with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS), coated with 50 nm gold, and analyzed by SEM with three magnifications. Result: There were visible wrinkles in the leaf structure due to improper preparation.  Conclusion: One of the samples showed the presence of microporosity measuring 0.689 μm and 0.5512 μm. The other sample showed a wrinkled surface due to errors in sample preparation.",

    "abstract": "Background: Candida albicans is a fungus that normally lives in the human oral cavity. About 30-60% of Candida albicans grows in the oral cavity of adults and 45-65% of Candida albicans grows in the oral cavity of infants. Excessive growth of Candida albicans can cause Candidiasis. The use of conventional antifungal drugs can cause side effects such as gastrointestinal. The existence of side effects from the use of antifungal drugs encourages research to find alternative treatments. Kecombrang is one of the plants whose content has potential as an alternative antifungal material because of its phytochemical content. Aim: The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the inhibition of kecombrang leaves against the growth of Candida albicans using the infusion method at a concentration of 5%, 7.5%, 10%. Methods: Kecombrang leaves were extracted into infusion solution, then diluted by adding distilled water to become kecombrang leaf infusa with a concentration of 5%, 7.5% and 10%.

    "abstract": "Background: Porphyromonas gingivalis was a pathogenic bacterium that played a role in the development of periodontal diseases, such as periodontitis. Effective treatment to inhibit the growth of this bacterium was highly needed. Chitosan, a biopolymer extracted from the shell of the mud crab (Scylla serrata), was known to have potential antibacterial properties. Objective: The aim of the study was to determine the antibacterial effectiveness of chitosan derived from the shell of the mud crab (Scylla serrata) at concentrations of 0.25%, 0.5%, and 1% against the growth of Porphyromonas gingivalis. Methods: This study was an in vitro laboratory investigation. Chitosan was extracted using the deacetylation technique from chitin isolated from the shell of the mud crab. The antibacterial effectiveness against Porphyromonas gingivalis was evaluated using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method with chitosan concentrations of 0.25%, 0.5%, and 1% to measure the diameter of the inhibition zone. The positive control used in this study was 0.2% chlorhexidine. Results: Chitosan exhibited significant antibacterial activity against Porphyromonas gingivalis, with the inhibition zone increasing as the chitosan concentration increased. This indicated the potential of chitosan as an effective natural antibacterial agent in controlling bacterial infections associated with periodontal disease. Conclusion: Chitosan derived from the shell of the mud crab (Scylla serrata) had antibacterial effects against Porphyromonas gingivalis.\r\n\r\nKeywords: antibacterial, chitosan mangrove crab, periodontal disease, Porphyromonas gingivalis",

    "abstract": "Background: Dental anxiety was an emotional response commonly experienced by patients during dental treatment and could affect their cooperation as well as the success of clinical procedures. One of the treatments that most often triggered high anxiety was tooth extraction, particularly when performed by clinical dental students who were still in the learning phase. This condition could cause psychological tension in patients, thus requiring non-pharmacological approach to help reduce anxiety. Classical music therapy was known to have calming effect by influencing central nervous system and maintaining physiological balance. Objective: This study aimed to determine the effect of classical music on the anxiety levels of patients undergoing tooth extraction performed by professional-level dental students at RSKGM Province of South Sumatera. Methods: This was prospective experimental study with pre and post control design involving 44 tooth extraction patients. Respondents were divided into two groups: the treatment group, which received an intervention in the form of playing Gymnopédie No. 1 by Erik Satie through true wireless stereo before the procedure, and the control group, which received no music intervention. Anxiety levels were measured using the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale for Dental Extraction Procedure (MDAS-DEP) questionnaire and analyzed using the Wilcoxon test with SPSS version 26. Results: Wilcoxon test showed a p-value of 0.000 (p<0.05), indicating significant relationship between classical music intervention and reduction in patients anxiety levels. Conclusion: Classical music had significant effect in reducing patient anxiety during tooth extraction procedures and could be used as simple and effective non-pharmacological approach in dentistry.",

    "abstract": "Dental health is an essential component of overall health that affects individual well-being and productivity. The 2023 Indonesian Health Survey reported a high prevalence of oral and dental problems and a low utilisation of dental health services. PT X, a state-owned enterprises in Palembang, provides additional health insurance for its employees and their families through PT Y. This study aims to describe the utilisation of dental and oral health services among PT X employees and their families in 2023, based on month of visit, age, gender, diagnosis, visit frequency, type of healthcare facility, and participant status. This study employed a descriptive observational design with a cross-sectional approach, using secondary data from PT Y health insurance claims in 2023. The results showed that out of 6,760 insured participants, only 2,376 utilized dental and oral health services. The highest number of visits occurred in October, while the lowest was in April. Adults aged 26–45 years dominated the visits, and females utilized the services more frequently than males. The most common diagnosis was dental caries (K02), followed by diseases of the pulp and periapical tissues (K04), and gingival and periodontal diseases (K05). Most participants made only one visit throughout the year, and the majority sought treatment at hospitals, with employees’ children being the largest user group. The utilisation rate of dental and oral health services among PT X employees and their families remains relatively low, indicating the need for increased awareness regarding the importance of dental health.",

    "abstract": "Background: Overweight is a condition where body weight exceeds the normal range due to excess fat, but it does not yet qualify as obesity. Obesity is a more severe condition characterized by excessive fat accumulation that increases the risk of health problems. Both conditions result from an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure and are becoming increasingly common among children. These conditions can affect overall health, including oral health. Dental caries is a common problem in children. The relationship between obesity and overweight with dental caries in children has shown varying results in previous studies, indicating the need for further investigation. Methods: This study used an analytic observational design with a cross-sectional approach at SDIT Al-Furqon Palembang. A total of 30 children who met the inclusion criteria were selected using purposive sampling. Data were collected through clinical examinations, including measurements of height and weight to determine nutritional status of obesity and overweight based on BMI-for-age Z-scores, as well as dental examinations using the def-t index (primary teeth) and the DMF-T index (permanent teeth). Results: The average def-t index for obese children was 4.3 and for overweight children was 4.2 (moderate category), while the DMF-T scores were 0.1 for obese children and 0.2 for overweight children (very low category). The chi-square test results showed a P-value of 0.209 (P > 0.05) for the association between obesity and overweight with the def-t index, and a P-value of 0.309 (P > 0.05) for the association with the DMF-T index. Conclusion: This study found that obesity and overweight had no influence on the dental caries condition of children aged 6–8 years at SDIT Al-Furqon Palembang.",

    "abstract": "Tooth loss is a common oral health problem among geriatric patients (elderly). If left untreated, tooth loss can lead to diminished oral cavity functions, ultimately impacting overall quality of life. One common intervention is the\r\nfabrication of dentures to replace missing teeth, restore their function, and enhance quality of life. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between denture use and the quality of life in geriatric patients. Methods: This research employed a cross-sectional study design using the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI) questionnaire, which consists of 12 items. The study was conducted over a one-month period and involved 52 respondents. Results: This study shows that the relationship between denture use and quality of life of geriatric\r\npatients does not show significance. Conclusion: The oral health-related quality of life of geriatric patients at Mohammad Hoesin Hospital, Palembang, was generally good. Furthermore, factors such as the type of dentures, the time of fabrication, and the place of fabrication did not have a significant effect on their quality of life",
